Shortly after that investigation was published,Mozillasaid it would stop bundling Onerep with theFirefoxbrowser and wind down its partnership with the company. But nearly a year later, Mozilla is still promoting it to Firefox users.Mozilla offers Onerep to Firefox users on a subscription basis as part ofMozilla Monitor Plus. Launched in 2018 under the nameFirefox Monitor, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the websiteHave I Been Pwned?to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.The ink on that partnership agreement had barely dried before KrebsOnSecuritypublished a storyshowing that Onerep\u2019s Belarusian CEO and founderDimitiri Shelestlaunched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker calledNuwberthat sells background reports on people. This seemed to contradict Onerep\u2019s stated motto, \u201cWe believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.\u201dShelest releaseda lengthy statement(PDF) wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake inNuwber, a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 \u2014 around the same time he started Onerep.Onerep.com CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest, as pictured on the \u201cabout\u201d page of onerep.com.Shelest maintained that Nuwber has \u201czero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,\u201d and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.\u201cI get it,\u201d Shelest wrote. \u201cMy affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn\u2019t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn\u2019t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I\u2019m aiming to do better in the future.\u201dWhen asked to comment on the findings, Mozilla said then that although customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep\u2019s CEO did not align with their values.\u201cWe\u2019re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first,\u201d Mozillasaid.In October 2024, Mozilla published a statement saying the search for a different provider was taking longer than anticipated.\u201cWhile we continue to evaluate vendors, finding a technically excellent and values-aligned partner takes time,\u201d Mozillawrote. \u201cWhile we continue this search, Onerep will remain the backend provider, ensuring that we can maintain uninterrupted services while we continue evaluating new potential partners that align more closely with Mozilla\u2019s values and user expectations. We are conducting thorough diligence to find the right vendor.\u201dAsked for an update, Mozilla said the search for a replacement partner continues.\u201cThe work\u2019s ongoing but we haven\u2019t found the right alternative yet,\u201d Mozilla said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur customers\u2019 data remains safe, and since the product provides a lot of value to our subscribers, we\u2019ll continue to offer it during this process.\u201dIt\u2019s a win-win for Mozilla that they\u2019ve received accolades for their principled response while continuing to partner with Onerep almost a year later. But if it takes so long to find a suitable replacement, what does that say about the personal data removal industry itself?Onerep appears to be working in partnership with another problematic people-search service:Radaris, which has a history of ignoring opt-out requests or failing to honor them. A week before breaking the story about Onerep, KrebsOnSecuritypublished researchshowing the co-founders of Radaris were two native Russian brothers who\u2019d built a vast network of affiliate marketing programs and consumer data broker services.Lawyers for the Radaris co-founders threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that story was retracted in full, claiming the founders were in fact Ukrainian and that our reporting had defamed the brothers by associating them with the actions of Radaris. Instead, we publisheda follow-up investigationwhich showed that not only did the brothers from Russia create Radaris, for many years they issued press releases quoting a fictitious CEO seeking money from investors.Several readers have shared emails they received from Radaris after attempting to remove their personal data, and those messages show Radaris has been promoting Onerep.An email from Radaris promoting Onerep.", "date": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:14:47 +0000", "source": "Krebs on Security", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "2": {"id": 1, "title": "This Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its Superpower", "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/diverse-backgrounds-security-superpower", "summary": "Credible Security's founders bring their varied experiences to help growing companies turn trust into a strategic advantage.", "content": "Cyber RiskCybersecurity OperationsCybersecurity In-Depth: Feature articles on security strategy, latest trends, and people to know.This Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its SuperpowerThis Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its SuperpowerThis Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its SuperpowerCredible Security's founders bring their varied experiences to help growing companies turn trust into a strategic advantage.Mercedes Cardona,Contributing Writer, Dark ReadingFebruary 14, 20254 MinReadSource: Ronstik via Alamy Stock PhotoTeaching students or learning the classics may not be the typical career path for cybersecurity professionals, but the founders of independent security consultancy Credible Security believe a diversity of backgrounds can be a superpower.\"Working together has taught us that the thing that makes the difference between an acceptable and a great approach to security within any organization is not technical knowledge or skill sets or backgrounds,\" says co-founder Josh Yavor. Qualifications are a given, but more importantly, a security team needs leadership \"empowered in the right ways with empathy and effective communication and a bias toward building relationships that are based on trust.\"Yavor, along with Kim Burton and Jessica Walters, launched Credible Security at the start of 2025. The company works with business-to-business companies that offer cloud services and software-as-a-service, with a specific focus on underserved teams within organizations. That includes go-to-market teams that have public-facing functions and early-stage companies that are finding their security footing while still forming a growth strategy.Diversity Leads to Stronger Security MindsetThe founding partners \u2014 \"We haven't really fought over those titles yet,\" Yavor jokes \u2014 had worked together before at Tessian, Cisco, and Duo Security. When Proofpoint acquired Tessian in 2023, Yavor was CISO, Burton was head of trust and compliance, and Waters was senior security manager. They each had extensive security experience but had taken different paths to get there.Prior to holding security leadership roles at Cisco Secure, Duo Security, and Facebook, Yavor was a school teacher and owned an IT consulting business. Burton studied literature and classical languages in graduate school. Walters was chief of staff of Cisco's Security Business Group team. All three say their experiences at Duo Security demonstrated the value of bringing together practitioners from different backgrounds. They stayed at Duo through its Cisco acquisition in 2018 and landed in the same team at Cisco. When Yavor joined Tessian in 2021, Burton and Walters \"came over to continue the journey.\"The team members' varied backgrounds \"make it so that when you encounter something that you haven't seen before, everyone is able to actually relate to something that they have, in fact, experienced,\" Burton says. \"When you have a team of people who've come from the same programs, the same location, the same ideas all the time, you actually end up with groupthink. We do not have that problem.\"Developing Strategy With a Trusted PartnerHaving different perspectives is particularly important when helping customers develop and execute their cloud strategies, according to the trio. Cloud services touch every aspect of people's lives, so B2B enterprises need to prioritize building trust with end users as part of their strategy. In the past 10 to 15 years, enterprises have made strides in thinking about risk and how to manage it,\u00a0but they haven't mastered the strategy in all areas, Yavor says.The missing part that Credible Security targets \"is having consistent strategy and outcomes in evaluating and delivering trust on both sides of the equation [end users and service providers],\" Yavor says. Trust is critical at every juncture of that pipeline; with some proactive security thinking and investment, businesses can boost results.\"We are helping our clients simplify their strategies and align them to their actual business objectives so that they have a much easier and more efficient approach to developing not just minimum viable security for whatever their product is, but actually using it as a competitive advantage as they try to earn their customers' trust and then maintain it through a long-term relationship,\" Yavor says.When managing risk, many companies still conflate trust with compliance, \"where you're doing checkbox exercises because you have to show up to an auditor and tell them about it. But that's a backward way of thinking about it,\" Burton says. Compliance is only a way to verify trustworthiness, and trust develops as consultants show that they are working with the same values and goals in mind.\"It's saying: 'Hey, how can you actually design your product and your process so that the customers that you are finding actually understand this deep-felt sense that they know you will do the best by them?'\"'Layered Experiences'Another advantage Credible Security offers is the ability to tap the team's experience as both buyers of security products and on the developer side of the process.\"All three of us have these layered experiences of both things we've done or built, but then also seeing teams and brands that really showed up in a way that we would want family members to experience,\" Walters says. The variety of positions they have held \u2014 CISO, head of compliance, chief of staff \u2014 also give them internal perspective, Yavor adds.\"That's actually one of the most exciting differentiators about our company, that all three of us, we haven't just been in the industry, we have been in the roles that we are seeking to help,\" he says. \"We've actually done the work.\"Read more about:CISO CornerAbout the AuthorMercedes CardonaContributing Writer, Dark ReadingMercedes Cardona is a New York-based business journalist.

That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users\u2019 financial information was not exposed.According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet\u2019s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.\u201cOn July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer websiteportal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,\u201d according to the Nelnet.It\u2019s unclear what the vulnerability was.\u201cOn August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,\u201d according to the letter.Loan Recipient TargetsAlthough users\u2019 most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach \u201chas potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,\u201d explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.\u201cWith recent news of student loan forgiveness, it\u2019s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,\u201d Bischoping said.Last week, the Biden administration announced aplanto cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.\u201cBecause they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,\u201d she wrote.According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing\u2019s cybersecurity team \u201ctook immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.\u201dRemediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.", "date": "Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000", "source": "Threatpost", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "5": {"id": 1, "title": "Microsoft Patch Tuesday, February 2025 Edition", "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/microsoft-patch-tuesday-february-2025-edition/", "summary": "Microsoft today issued security updates to fix at least 56 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software, including two zero-day flaws that are being actively exploited.", "content": null, "date": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:58:37 +0000", "source": "Krebs on Security", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "6": {"id": 1, "title": "New FinalDraft Malware Spotted in Espionage Campaign", "link": "https://www.securityweek.com/new-finaldraft-malware-spotted-in-espionage-campaign/", "summary": "<p>A newly identified malware family abuses the Outlook mail service for communication, via the Microsoft Graph API.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/new-finaldraft-malware-spotted-in-espionage-campaign/\">New FinalDraft Malware Spotted in Espionage Campaign</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com\">SecurityWeek</a>.</p>", "content": null, "date": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:39:02 +0000", "source": "SecurityWeek", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "7": {"id": 1, "title": "CISO's Expert Guide To CTEM And Why It Matters", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/cisos-expert-guide-to-ctem-and-why-it.html", "summary": "Cyber threats evolve\u2014has your defense strategy kept up?

The escalating problem underscores the need for companies pursuing internal AI projects to have robust mechanisms to detect security flaws and malicious code within their supply chains.Hugging Face's automated checks, for example, recently failed to detect malicious code in two AI models hosted on the repository, according to a Feb. 3 analysis published by software supply chain security firm ReversingLabs. The threat actor used a common vector \u2014 data files using the Pickle format \u2014\u00a0with a new technique,dubbed \"NullifAI,\"to evade detection.While the attacks appeared to be proofs-of-concept, their success in being hosted with a \"No issue\" tag shows that companies should not rely on Hugging Face's and other repositories' safety checks for their own security, says Tomislav Pericin, chief software architect at ReversingLabs.\"You have this public repository where any developer or machine learning expert can host their own stuff, and obviously malicious actors abuse that,\" he says. \"Depending on the ecosystem, the vector is going to be slightly different, but the idea is the same: Someone's going to host a malicious version of a thing and hope for you to inadvertently install it.\"Related:This Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its SuperpowerCompanies are quickly adopting AI, and the majority are also establishing internal projects using open source AI models from repositories \u2014 such as Hugging Face, TensorFlow Hub, and PyTorch Hub. Overall, 61% of companies are using models from the open source ecosystem to create their own AI tools, according to aMorning Consult surveyof 2,400 IT decision-makers sponsored by IBM.Yet many of the components can contain executable code, leading to a variety of security risks, such as code execution, backdoors, prompt injections, and alignment issues \u2014 the latter being how well an AI model matches the intent of the developers and users.In an Insecure PickleOne significant issue is that a commonly used data format,known as a Pickle file, is not secure and can be used to execute arbitrary code. Despite vocal warnings from security researchers, thePickle formatcontinues to be used by many data scientists, says Tom Bonner, vice president of research at HiddenLayer, an AI-focused detection and response firm.\"I really hoped that we'd make enough noise about it that Pickle would've gone by now, but it's not,\" he says. \"I've seen organizations compromised through machine learning models \u2014 multiple [organizations] at this point. So yeah, whilst it's not an everyday occurrence such as ransomware or phishing campaigns, it does happen.\"Related:How Banks Can Adapt to the Rising Threat of Financial CrimeWhile Hugging Face has explicit checks for Pickle files, the malicious code discovered by ReversingLabs sidestepped those checks by using a different file compression for the data. Other research by application security firm Checkmarx found multiple ways to bypass the scanners, such as PickleScan used by Hugging Face, to detect dangerous Pickle files.Despite having malicious features, this model passes security checks on Hugging Face. Source: ReversingLabs\"PickleScan uses a blocklist which was successfully bypassed using both built-in Python dependencies,\" Dor Tumarkin, director of application security research at Checkmarx,stated in the analysis. \"It is plainly vulnerable, but by using third-party dependencies such as Pandas to bypass it, even if it were to considerallcases baked into Python, it would still be vulnerable with very popular imports in its scope.\"Rather than Pickle files, data science and AI teams should move to Safetensors \u2014 a library for a new data format managed by Hugging Face, EleutherAI, and Stability AI \u2014\u00a0whichhas been audited for security. The Safetensors format is considered much safer than the Pickle format.Related:Warning: Tunnel of Love Leads to ScamsDeep-Seated AI VulnerabilitiesExecutable data files are not the only threats, however. Licensing is another issue: While pretrained AI models are frequently called \"open source AI,\" they generally do not provide all the information needed to reproduce the AI model, such as code and training data. Instead, they provide the weights generated by the training and are covered by licenses that are not always open source compatible.Creating commercial products or services from such models can potentially result in violating the licenses, says Andrew Stiefel, a senior product manager at Endor Labs.\"There's a lot of complexity in the licenses for models,\" he says. \"You have the actual model binary itself, the weights, the training data, all of those could have different licenses, and you need to understand what that means for your business.\"Model alignment \u2014 how well its output aligns with the developers' and users' values \u2014 is the final wildcard. DeepSeek, for example, allows users to create malware and viruses,researchers found. Other models \u2014 such as OpenAI's o3-mini model, which boasts more stringent alignment \u2014 hasalready been jail broken by researchers.These problems are unique to AI systems and the boundaries of how to test for such weaknesses remains a fertile field for researchers, says ReversingLabs' Pericin.\"There is already research about what kind of prompts would trigger the model to behave in an unpredictable way, divulge confidential information, or teach things that could be harmful,\" he says. \"That's a whole other discipline of machine learning model safety that people are, in all honesty, mostly worried about today.\"Companies should make sure to understand any licenses covering the AI models they are using. In addition, they should pay attention to common signals of software safety, including the source of the model, development activity around the model, its popularity, and the operational and security risks, Endor's Stiefel says.\"You kind of need to manage AI models like you would any other open source dependencies,\" Stiefel says. \"They're built by people outside of your organization and you're bringing them in, and so that means you need to take that same holistic approach to looking at risks.\"About the AuthorRobert Lemos, Contributing WriterVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

Also known as \u201cDiamondCDN,\u201d Packetwarecurrently hoststesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.DiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname \u201cRivage\u201d on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as \u201cEdward.\u201dFrom late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage\u2019s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.Rivage made that request in the cybercrime channel \u201cDstat,\u201d a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services.Dstat\u2019s website dstat[.]cc was seizedin 2024 as part of \u201cOperation PowerOFF,\u201d an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.Coristine\u2019s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company calledPath Networks, whichWiredgenerously described as a \u201cnetwork monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.\u201dWiredwrote:\u201cAt Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Path has at times listed as employeesEric Taylor, also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It\u2019s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.\u201dThe founder of Path is a young man namedMarshal Webb. I wrote about Webb back in 2016, in a story about a DDoS defense company he co-founded calledBackConnect Security LLC. On September 20, 2016, KrebsOnSecurity published data showing that the companyhad a history of hijacking Internet address space that belonged to others.Less than 24 hours after that story ran, KrebsOnSecurity.com washit with the biggest DDoS attack the Internet had ever seen at the time. That sustained attackkept this site offline for nearly 4 days.The other founder of BackConnect Security LLC wasTucker Preston, a Georgia man whopleaded guilty in 2020to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.The aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylorpleaded guilty in 2017to charges includingan attack on our home in 2013. Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as \u201cswatting.\u201dCosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackersset up the Web site exposed[dot]su, which \u201cdoxed\u201d dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed.Wirednoted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn\u2019t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the websitepathtruths.comincludes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine\u2019s firing.According to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine\u2019s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path\u2019s technicians was a Canadian man namedCurtis Gervaiswho was convicted in 2017 ofperpetrating dozens of swatting attacks and fake bomb threats\u2014 including at least two attempts against our home in 2014.A snippet of text from an internal Path chat room, wherein members discuss the reason for Coristine\u2019s termination: Allegedly, leaking internal company information. Source: Pathtruths.com.On May 11, 2024, Rivage posted on a Discord channel for a DDoS protection service that is chiefly marketed to members of The Com. Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of money to be made in the com,\u201d Rivage lamented. \u201cI\u2019m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.\u201dRivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that.Wiredreports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working atNeuralink, Elon Musk\u2019s brain implant startup.The trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.That\u2019s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.Experts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That\u2019s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.And make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the communityperiodically spill over into real-world violence.When Coristine\u2019s name surfaced inWired\u2018s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice.\u00a0In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage\u2019s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.2025-02-05 16:29:44 UTC vperked#0 they got this nigga on indiatimes man2025-02-05 16:29:46 UTC alexaloo#0 Their cropping is worse than AI could have done2025-02-05 16:29:48 UTC hebeatsme#0 bro who is that2025-02-05 16:29:53 UTC hebeatsme#0 yalla re talking about2025-02-05 16:29:56 UTC xewdy#0 edward2025-02-05 16:29:56 UTC .yarrb#0 rivagew2025-02-05 16:29:57 UTC vperked#0 Rivarge2025-02-05 16:29:57 UTC xewdy#0 diamondcdm2025-02-05 16:29:59 UTC vperked#0 i cant spell it2025-02-05 16:30:00 UTC hebeatsme#0 rivage2025-02-05 16:30:08 UTC .yarrb#0 yes2025-02-05 16:30:14 UTC hebeatsme#0 i have him added2025-02-05 16:30:20 UTC hebeatsme#0 hes on discord still2025-02-05 16:30:47 UTC .yarrb#0 hes focused on stroking zaddy elon2025-02-05 16:30:47 UTC vperked#0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Coristine2025-02-05 16:30:50 UTC vperked#0 no fucking way2025-02-05 16:30:53 UTC vperked#0 they even made a wiki for him2025-02-05 16:30:55 UTC vperked#0 LOOOL2025-02-05 16:31:05 UTC hebeatsme#0 no way2025-02-05 16:31:08 UTC hebeatsme#0 hes not a good dev either2025-02-05 16:31:14 UTC hebeatsme#0 like????2025-02-05 16:31:22 UTC hebeatsme#0 has to be fake2025-02-05 16:31:24 UTC xewdy#0 and theyre saying ts2025-02-05 16:31:29 UTC xewdy#0 like ok bro2025-02-05 16:31:51 UTC .yarrb#0 now i wanna know what all the other devs are like\u20262025-02-05 16:32:00 UTC vperked#0 \u201c`Coristine used the moniker \u201cbigballs\u201d on LinkedIn and @Edwardbigballer on Twitter, according to The Daily Dot.[\u201c`2025-02-05 16:32:05 UTC vperked#0 LOL2025-02-05 16:32:06 UTC hebeatsme#0 lmfaooo2025-02-05 16:32:07 UTC vperked#0 bro2025-02-05 16:32:10 UTC hebeatsme#0 bro2025-02-05 16:32:17 UTC hebeatsme#0 has to be fake right2025-02-05 16:32:22 UTC .yarrb#0 does it mention Rivage?2025-02-05 16:32:23 UTC xewdy#0 He previously worked for NeuraLink, a brain computer interface company led by Elon Musk2025-02-05 16:32:26 UTC xewdy#0 bro what2025-02-05 16:32:27 UTC alexaloo#0 I think your current occupation gives you a good insight of what probably goes on2025-02-05 16:32:29 UTC hebeatsme#0 bullshit man2025-02-05 16:32:33 UTC xewdy#0 this nigga got hella secrets2025-02-05 16:32:37 UTC hebeatsme#0 rivage couldnt print hello world2025-02-05 16:32:42 UTC hebeatsme#0 if his life was on the line2025-02-05 16:32:50 UTC xewdy#0 nigga worked for neuralink2025-02-05 16:32:54 UTC hebeatsme#0 bullshit2025-02-05 16:33:06 UTC Nashville Dispatch ##0000 ||@PD Ping||2025-02-05 16:33:07 UTC hebeatsme#0 must have killed all those test pigs with some bugs2025-02-05 16:33:24 UTC hebeatsme#0 ur telling me the rivage who failed to start a company2025-02-05 16:33:28 UTC hebeatsme#0 https://cdn.camp2025-02-05 16:33:32 UTC hebeatsme#0 who didnt pay for servers2025-02-05 16:33:34 UTC hebeatsme#0 ?2025-02-05 16:33:42 UTC hebeatsme#0 was too cheap2025-02-05 16:33:44 UTC vperked#0 yes2025-02-05 16:33:50 UTC hebeatsme#0 like??2025-02-05 16:33:53 UTC hebeatsme#0 it aint adding up2025-02-05 16:33:56 UTC alexaloo#0 He just needed to find his calling idiot.2025-02-05 16:33:58 UTC alexaloo#0 He found it.2025-02-05 16:33:59 UTC hebeatsme#0 bro2025-02-05 16:34:01 UTC alexaloo#0 Cope in a river dude2025-02-05 16:34:04 UTC hebeatsme#0 he cant make good money right2025-02-05 16:34:08 UTC hebeatsme#0 doge is about efficiency2025-02-05 16:34:11 UTC hebeatsme#0 he should make $1/he2025-02-05 16:34:15 UTC hebeatsme#0 $1/hr2025-02-05 16:34:25 UTC hebeatsme#0 and be whipped for better code2025-02-05 16:34:26 UTC vperked#0 prolly makes more than us2025-02-05 16:34:35 UTC vperked#0 with his dad too2025-02-05 16:34:52 UTC hebeatsme#0 time to report him for fraud2025-02-05 16:34:54 UTC hebeatsme#0 to donald trump2025-02-05 16:35:04 UTC hebeatsme#0 rivage participated in sim swap hacks in 20182025-02-05 16:35:08 UTC hebeatsme#0 put that on his wiki2025-02-05 16:35:10 UTC hebeatsme#0 thanks2025-02-05 16:35:15 UTC hebeatsme#0 and in 20212025-02-05 16:35:17 UTC hebeatsme#0 thanks2025-02-05 16:35:19 UTC chainofcommand#0 i dont think they\u2019ll care tbhGiven the speed with which Musk\u2019s DOGE team was allowed access to such critical government databases, it strains credulity that Coristine could have been properly cleared beforehand. After all, he\u2019d recently been dismissed from a jobfor allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders.According to the national security adjudicationguidelines(PDF) released by theDirector of National Intelligence(DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.The DNI policy further states that \u201celigibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.\u201dOn Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff memberMarko Elezresigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned afterThe Wall Street Journalaskedthe White House about his connection to the account.\u201cJust for the record, I was racist before it was cool,\u201d the account posted in July. \u201cYou could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,\u201d the account wrote on X in September. \u201cNormalize Indian hate,\u201d the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.Elez\u2019s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez andTom Krause, the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.Earlier today, Musksaid he planned to rehire ElezafterPresident TrumpandVice President JD Vancereportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was \u201cvery proud of the job that this group of young people\u201d are doing.A White House officialtoldReuterson Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in \u201cfull compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.\u201dNPRreportsTrump added that his administration\u2019s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, \u201cwhere he suggested without evidence that there could be \u2018trillions\u2019 of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.\u201dGOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk\u2019s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.Meanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE\u2019s activities. ABC Newssaysa federal judge was to rule today on whether DOGE should be blocked from accessing Department of Labor records, following a lawsuit alleging Musk\u2019s team sought to illegally access highly sensitive data, including medical information, from the federal government.At least 13 state attorneys general say they plan to file a lawsuit to stop DOGE from accessing federal payment systems containing Americans\u2019 sensitive personal information,reportsThe Associated Press.Reutersreported Thursdaythat the U.S. Treasury Department had agreed not to give Musk\u2019s team access to its payment systems while a judge is hearing arguments in a lawsuit by employee unions and retirees alleging Musk illegally searched those records.Ars Technicawritesthat The Department of Education (DoE) was sued Friday by a California student association demanding an \u201cimmediate stop\u201d to DOGE\u2019s \u201cunlawfully\u201d digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle the DoE.", "date": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 00:32:53 +0000", "source": "Krebs on Security", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "10": {"id": 1, "title": "\u26a1 THN Weekly Recap: Google Secrets Stolen, Windows Hack, New Crypto Scams and More", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/thn-weekly-recap-google-secrets-stolen.html", "summary": "Welcome to this week\u2019s Cybersecurity News Recap.

The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to aTuesday reportby Proofpoint\u2019s Threat Research Team and PwC\u2019s Threat Intelligence team.The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. \u201cProofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, whichmultiplereportsassessto operate out of Hainan Island, China,\u201d according to the report.The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. \u201cA 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),\u201d researchers said.MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People\u2019s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.Dusting Off the ScanBoxThe campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.\u201cScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn\u2019t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information \u2013 the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,\u201d according to PwC researchersreferring to a previous campaign.In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user\u2019s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.TA423\u2019s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as \u201cSick Leave,\u201d \u201cUser Research\u201d and \u201cRequest Cooperation.\u201d Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the \u201cAustralian Morning News,\u201d a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their \u201chumble news website,\u201d australianmorningnews[.]com.\u201cUpon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,\u201d researchers wrote.The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.\u201cThe module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,\u201d researchers explain.Adversaries can then leverage a technology calledSTUN(Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.\u201cSTUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application\u2019s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part ofInteractive Connectivity Establishment(ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,\u201d according to researchers.\u201cThis means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,\u201d they explain.Threat ActorsThe threat actors \u201csupport the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,\u201d Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, \u201cThis group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can\u2019t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.\u201dThe group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justiceindictmentfrom July, 2021, the group has \u201cstolen trade secrets and confidential business information\u201d from victims in \u201cthe United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.\u201dDespite the DoJ indictment, analysts \u201chave not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo\u201d from TA423, and they \u201ccollectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.\u201d", "date": "Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000", "source": "Threatpost", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "12": {"id": 1, "title": "Industry Moves for the week of February 17, 2025 - SecurityWeek", "link": "https://www.securityweek.com/industry-moves/feb-17-2025/", "summary": "Explore industry moves and significant changes in the industry for the week of February 17, 2025.

By understanding the threats and building strong collaborations, banks can protect themselves and their clients.Alena Robertson,BSA Manager, Grasshopper BankFebruary 14, 20254 MinReadSource: Panther Media GmbH via Alamy Stock PhotoCOMMENTARYBanking executives have a lot to consider when it comes to financial crime. With new technologies at their disposal,fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated, underscoring the importance of staying vigilant in protecting against these emerging threats. In the near future,synthetic identity fraudand account takeovers will increasingly be leveraged to maximize gains, and AI and machine learning will rapidly adapt to a bank's detection methods. While most banks recognize the importance of fraud prevention, having a clear strategy and best practices is essential to mitigate the rising risks posed by these evolving technologies.Risk of Fraud and Financial Crimes GrowsLast year, US fraud losses totaled a staggering $12.3 billion, and the emergence of new technologies will amplify financial crimes further.Research from Deloitteexpects US fraud losses to grow to $40 billion by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32%. Generative AI is one reason why bank fraud is growing. At Grasshopper, we've seenfraudsters try to use generative AI(GenAI) to create fake business profiles and descriptions when applying for small business loans. To combat this, banks need to implement advanced AI-driven fraud monitoring and detection tools, enhance identity verification processes, and stay vigilant with continuous monitoring and staff training to recognize anomalies.The rise of banking-as-a-service (BaaS) and embedded banking has also created more opportunities for bad actors to try to exploit gaps in fraud prevention. In this model, banks lose the direct connection with the end user, adding complexity to fraud prevention efforts. BaaS and embedded finance solutions offer significant advantages for modern banking, but they also present new challenges in fraud prevention.PYMNTS.com reportsthat bad actors are targeting application programming interfaces (APIs) \u2014 serving as the bridge between banks and their BaaS partners \u2014 are being viewed by bad actors as entry points. Earlier this year, attacks on APIs were up 20% year over year. Although the benefits of BaaS far outweigh the risks, fraud activity continues to accelerate. To stay protected, banks and their BaaS partners need a systemic approach to manage risk tolerance across the platform and protect themselves and their clients.Implementing Best Practices for a Strong BaaS PartnershipBanks and BaaS partners who collaborate closely to continuously improve their risk programs can navigate the evolving risks and rewards of AI. The most successful way to be effective and successful in preventing fraud is to have a shared understanding of the risk appetite and compliance program. Sometimes, this will mean the bank has to say no to a potential BaaS partnership, if the partner doesn't align with the bank's risk culture. This can be as simple as one partner shifting focus to a specific industry that the other is not as committed to serving. If one partner is choosing to pivot in a specific direction and the other is not, the partnership is no longer aligned. A shared understanding should be established at the onset of the relationship, but partners should also routinely check in to ensure they remain aligned, as risk appetite is always evolving alongside growth.The partnership should also clearly identify roles and responsibilities to create clarity and transparency in the fraud prevention strategy. The professionals engaged in the relationship should know how responsibilities are allocated to create a solid foundation of the risk framework. From there, teams should share resources through joint training programs and guides for new regulation or threat activity. Ultimately, a robust program doesn't just identify gaps \u2014 it actively closes them. Through regular audits and swift, actionable responses, it ensures vulnerabilities are eliminated, keeping fraud prevention strong and resilient. By embracing these strategies, banks can confidently drive the innovation economy forward, unlocking the full potential of BaaS partnerships while safeguarding against financial crime.The Human Response Is EssentialTechnology is a critical component of a successful fraud prevention program, but it can't stand alone. The fact is, humans have an innate ability to detect when something doesn't feel right \u2014 robotic behavior, no matter how sophisticated, still raises red flags for human analysts. Outliers that slip past automated systems are often identified by skilled anti-fraud professionals who can spot the subtle signs that machines miss.Banking fraud andfinancial crimesare growing more sophisticated every day, and the banking industry continues to evolve by forging relationships with new partners.

But experts caution that many of DeepSeek\u2019s design choices \u2014 such as using hard-coded encryption keys, and sending unencrypted user and device data to Chinese companies \u2014 introduce a number of glaring security and privacy risks.Public interest in the DeepSeek AI chat apps swelled following widespreadmediareports that the upstart Chinese AI firm had managed to match the abilities of cutting-edge chatbots while using a fraction of the specialized computer chips that leading AI companies rely on. As of this writing, DeepSeek is the third most-downloaded \u201cfree\u201d app on the Apple store, and #1 on Google Play.DeepSeek\u2019s rapid rise caught the attention of the mobile security firmNowSecure, a Chicago-based company that helps clients screen mobile apps for security and privacy threats. Ina teardownof the DeepSeek app published today, NowSecure urged organizations to remove the DeepSeek iOS mobile app from their environments, citing security concerns.NowSecure founderAndrew Hoogsaid they haven\u2019t yet concluded an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek app forAndroiddevices, but that there is little reason to believe its basic design would be functionally much different.Hoog told KrebsOnSecurity there were a number of qualities about the DeepSeek iOS app that suggest the presence of deep-seated security and privacy risks. For starters, he said, the app collects an awful lot of data about the user\u2019s device.\u201cThey are doing some very interesting things that are on the edge of advanced device fingerprinting,\u201d Hoog said, noting that one property of the app tracks the device\u2019s name \u2014 which for many iOS devices defaults to the customer\u2019s name followed by the type of iOS device.The device information shared, combined with the user\u2019s Internet address anddata gathered from mobile advertising companies, could be used to deanonymize users of the DeepSeek iOS app, NowSecure warned. The report notes that DeepSeek communicates withVolcengine, a cloud platform developed byByteDance(the makers ofTikTok), although NowSecure said it wasn\u2019t clear if the data is just leveraging ByteDance\u2019s digital transformation cloud service or if the declared information share extends further between the two companies.Image: NowSecure.Perhaps more concerning, NowSecure said the iOS app transmits device information \u201cin the clear,\u201d without any encryption to encapsulate the data. This means the data being handled by the app could be intercepted, read, and even modified by anyone who has access to any of the networks that carry the app\u2019s traffic.\u201cThe DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels,\u201d the report observed. \u201cSince this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet.\u201dHoog said the app does selectively encrypt portions of the responses coming from DeepSeek servers. But they also found it uses an insecure and now deprecated encryption algorithm called 3DES (akaTriple DES), and that the developers had hard-coded the encryption key. That means the cryptographic key needed to decipher those data fields can be extracted from the app itself.There were other, less alarming security and privacy issues highlighted in the report, but Hoog said he\u2019s confident there are additional, unseen security concerns lurking within the app\u2019s code.\u201cWhen we see people exhibit really simplistic coding errors, as you dig deeper there are usually a lot more issues,\u201d Hoog said. \u201cThere is virtually no priority around security or privacy. Whether cultural, or mandated by China, or a witting choice, taken together they point to significant lapse in security and privacy controls, and that puts companies at risk.\u201dApparently, plenty of others share this view.Axiosreportedon January 30 that U.S. congressional offices are being warned not to use the app.\u201c[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,\u201d read the notice from the chief administrative officer for the House of Representatives. \u201cTo mitigate these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek\u2019s functionality on all House-issued devices.\u201dTechCrunchreportsthat Italy and Taiwan have already moved to ban DeepSeek over security concerns.BloombergwritesthatThe Pentagonhas blocked access to DeepSeek.CNBCsaysNASAalso banned employees from using the service, as did theU.S. Navy.Beyond security concerns tied to the DeepSeek iOS app, there are indications the Chinese AI company may be playing fast and loose with the data that it collects from and about users. On January 29, researchers atWizsaidthey discovered a publicly accessible database linked to DeepSeek that exposed \u201ca significant volume of chat history, backend data and sensitive information, including log streams, API secrets, and operational details.\u201d\u201cMore critically, the exposure allowed for full database control and potential privilege escalation within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world,\u201d Wiz wrote.

The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.\u201cThe primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,\u201d wrote Group-IB researchersin a recent report. \u201cThese users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.\u201dImpacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. \u201cThe 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,\u201d he said.What the 0ktapus Hackers WantedThe 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets\u2019 phone numbers.While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.\u201c[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,\u201d researchers wrote.Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target\u2019s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.In an accompanyingtechnical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus\u2019 ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.Blast Radius: MFA AttacksIn ablog postDoorDash revealed; \u201cunauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.\u201d The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information \u2013 including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses \u2013 from customers and delivery people.In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.\u201cSecurity measures such as MFA can appear secure\u2026 but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,\u201d researchers wrote.\u201cThis is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,\u201d Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. \u201cIt simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It\u2019s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.\u201dTo mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and usingFIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.\u201cWhatever MFA someone uses,\u201d Grimes advised, \u201cthe user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don\u2019t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.\u201d", "date": "Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000", "source": "Threatpost", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "18": {"id": 1, "title": "Salt Typhoon Exploits Cisco Devices in Telco Infrastructure", "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/salt-typhoon-exploits-cisco-devices-telco-infrastructure", "summary": "The China-sponsored state espionage group has exploited known, older bugs in Cisco gear for successful cyber intrusions on six continents in the past two months.", "content": "Cyberattacks & Data BreachesEndpoint SecurityThreat IntelligenceICS/OT SecuritySalt Typhoon Exploits Cisco Devices in Telco InfrastructureSalt Typhoon Exploits Cisco Devices in Telco InfrastructureSalt Typhoon Exploits Cisco Devices in Telco InfrastructureThe China-sponsored state espionage group has exploited known, older bugs in Cisco gear for successful cyber intrusions on six continents in the past two months.Nate Nelson, Contributing WriterFebruary 14, 20254 MinReadSource: Imagechina Limited via Alamy Stock PhotoThe Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Salt Typhoon has targeted more than a thousand Cisco devices located within the infrastructures of telecommunications companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and universities.Salt Typhoon(aka RedMike, Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286) first made its name last fall, with explosive reports about its targetingmajor US telecommunications providers like T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. In the process, it managed toeavesdrop on US law enforcement wiretaps, and eventhe Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns.Apparently, all that new media attention did little to slow it down. According to Recorded Future's Insikt Group, Salt Typhoon \u2014 which Insikt tracks as \"RedMike\" \u2014attacked communications providers and research universities worldwideon six occasions in December and January. The group exploited old bugs in Cisco network devices to infiltrate its targets, and this may not actually be the first time it tried this tactic.In a statement to Dark Reading, a Cisco spokesperson wrote that \"We are aware of new reports that claim Salt Typhoon threat actors are exploiting two known vulnerabilities in Cisco devices relating to IOS XE. To date, we have not been able to validate these claims but continue to review available data.\" They added that \"In 2023, we issued a security advisory disclosing these vulnerabilities along with guidance for customers to urgently apply the available software fix. We strongly advise customers to patch known vulnerabilities that have been disclosed and follow industry best practices for securing management protocols.\"Related:Chinese APT 'Emperor Dragonfly' Moonlights With RansomwareSalt Typhoon's Latest Attacks on Elecom, UnisBack in October 2023, Cisco urged all of its customers to immediately pull all their routers, switches, etc., off the Web \u2014 at least those running the IOS XE operating system. An attacker had been actively exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the user interface (UI) which, without prior authorization, allowed them to create new local accounts with administrative privileges. The issue was assignedCVE-2023-20198, with the highest possible score of 10 out of 10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).Just a few days later, Cisco revealed a second IOS XE web UI vulnerability that was being exploited in tandem with CVE-2023-20198.CVE-2023-20273took the first vulnerability a step further, allowing attackers to run malicious commands on compromised devices using root privileges. It earned a \"high\" 7.2 CVSS score.Related:Salt Typhoon's Impact on the US & BeyondEvidently, Cisco's warnings were not heard loudly and widely enough, as Salt Typhoon followed this exact path to just recently compromise large organizations on six continents. With the complete power afforded by CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273, the threat actor would then configure Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels connecting compromised devices with its own infrastructure. It used this otherwise legitimate feature to establish persistence and enable data exfiltration, with less risk of detection by firewalls or network monitoring software.Though Insikt tracks this campaign only back through December, it's possible that this isn't the first time Salt Typhoon has used Cisco devices to target major telcos.\"Very little detail is currently publicly available about the Salt Typhoon-linked intrusions against US telecommunications providers uncovered in September 2024, including whether or not Cisco devices were involved,\" explains Jon Condra, senior director of strategic intelligence at Recorded Future. \"Notably, CISA in December 2024 put out defensive guidance for communications providers that implies that Cisco devices have been exploited, linked to the Salt Typhoon intrusions, without providing specifics. We do know that Cisco devices have been targeted by Chinese APT groups on many occasions in the past, as with a variety of other edge devices.\"Related:Magecart Attackers Abuse Google Ad Tool to Steal DataSalt Typhoon's Latest Cyberattack VictimsOrganizations affected by this campaign include a US affiliate of a UK telco, a US telco and ISP, an Italian ISP, a South African telco, a Thai telco, and Mytel, one of Myanmar's premier telcos.\"Salt Typhoon targets telecommunications systems which are some of the most complicated Frankenstein-esque examples of architectures that exist,\" explains Zach Edwards, senior threat researcher for Silent Push. That even old vulnerabilities might still be exploited against telcos, he suggests, isn't such a mystery: \"They possess some technologies in certain systems dating back decades that, in many cases, cannot be replaced, and with other modernized aspects that remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.\"And besides telcos and ISPs themselves, Salt Typhoon also attacked 13 universities, including the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and three more US institutions, plus more in Argentina, Indonesia, the Netherlands, etc. As Insikt noted, many of these universities perform significant research in telecommunications, engineering, and other areas of technology.Overall, while more than 100 countries have been touched by this campaign, more than half of the devices compromised have been in South America, India, and, most often, the US.Recorded Future's Condra emphasizes that while prior Salt Typhoon coverage has been US-centric, he says, \"The group\u2019s targetingextends far beyond US bordersand is truly global in scope. This speaks to strategic Chinese intelligence requirements to gain access to sensitive networks for the purposes of espionage, gaining the ability to disrupt or manipulate data flows, or pre-position themselves for disruptive or destructive action in the event of an escalation of geopolitical tensions or kinetic conflict.\"About the AuthorNate Nelson, Contributing WriterNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

The DOJ said the law enforcement action, dubbedOperation Talent, also seized domains tied toSellix, Cracked\u2019s payment processor.In addition, the government seized the domain names for two popular anonymity services that were heavily advertised on Cracked and Nulled and allowed customers to rent virtual servers:StarkRDP[.]io, andrdp[.]sh.Those archived webpages show both RDP services were owned by an entity called1337 Services Gmbh. According tocorporate recordscompiled byNorthdata.com, 1337 Services GmbH is also known asAS210558and is incorporated in Hamburg, Germany.The Cracked forum administrator went by the nicknames \u201cFlorainN\u201d and \u201cStarkRDP\u201d on multiple cybercrime forums. Meanwhile, aLinkedIn profilefor aFlorian M. from Germany refers to this person as the co-founder of Sellix and founder of 1337 Services GmbH.Northdata\u2019s business profile for 1337 Services GmbH shows the company is controlled by two individuals: 32-year-oldFlorian MarzahlandFinn Alexander Grimpe, 28.An organization chart showing the owners of 1337 Services GmbH as Florian Marzahl and Finn Grimpe. Image: Northdata.com.Neither Marzahl nor Grimpe responded to requests for comment. But Grimpe\u2019s first name is interesting because it corresponds to the nickname chosen by the founder of Nulled, who goes by the monikers \u201cFinn\u201d and \u201cFinndev.\u201d NorthData reveals that Grimpe was the founder of a German entity calledDreamDrive GmbH, which rented outhigh-end sports cars and motorcycles.According to the cyber intelligence firmIntel 471, a user named Finndev registered on multiple cybercrime forums, includingRaidforums[seized by the FBI in 2022],Void[.]to, andvDOS, a DDoS-for-hire service that wasshut down in 2016 after its founders were arrested.The email address used for those accounts wasf.grimpe@gmail.com.DomainTools.comreports f.grimpe@gmail.com was used to register at least nine domain names, includingnulled[.]lolandnulled[.]it. Neither of these domains were among those seized in Operation Talent.Intel471 finds the user FlorainN registered across multiple cybercrime forums using the email addressolivia.messla@outlook.de. The breach tracking serviceConstella Intelligencesays this email address used the same password (and slight variations of it) across many accounts online \u2014 including at hacker forums \u2014 and that the same password was used in connection with dozens of other email addresses, such asflorianmarzahl@hotmail.de,andfmarzahl137@gmail.com.The Justice Department said the Nulled marketplace had more than five million members, and has been selling stolen login credentials, stolen identification documents and hacking services, as well as tools for carrying out cybercrime and fraud, since 2016.Perhaps fittingly, both Cracked and Nulled have been hacked over the years, exposing countless private messages between forum users. A review of those messages archived by Intel 471 showed that dozens of early forum members referred privately to Finndev as the owner ofshoppy[.]gg, an e-commerce platform that caters to the same clientele as Sellix.Shoppy was not targeted as part of Operation Talent, and its website remains online. Northdatareportsthat Shoppy\u2019s business name \u2014Shoppy Ecommerce Ltd.\u2014 is registered at an address in Gan-Ner, Israel, but there is no ownership information about this entity. Shoppy did not respond to requests for comment.Constella found that a user named Shoppy registered on Cracked in 2019 using the email addressfinn@shoppy[.]gg. Constella says that email address is tied toa Twitter/X accountfor Shoppy Ecommerce in Israel.The DOJ said one of the alleged administrators of Nulled, a 29-year-old Argentinian national namedLucas Sohn, was arrested in Spain.\u00a0The government has not announced any other arrests or charges associated with Operation Talent.Indeed, both StarkRDP and FloraiN have posted to their accounts onTelegramthat there were no charges levied against the proprietors of 1337 Services GmbH.

According todatareleased byNCC Group, the resurgence is being led by old ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.With data gathered by \u201cactively monitoring the leak sites used by each ransomware group and scraping victim details as they are released,\u201d researchers have determined that Lockbit was by far the most prolific ransomware gang in July, behind 62 attacks. That\u2019s ten more than the month prior, and more than twice as many as the second and third most prolific groups combined. \u201cLockbit 3.0 maintain their foothold as the most threatening ransomware group,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cand one with which all organizations should aim to be aware of.\u201dThose second and third most prolific groups are Hiveleaks \u2013 27 attacks \u2013 and BlackBasta \u2013 24 attacks. These figures represent rapid rises for each group \u2013 since June, a 440 percent rise for Hiveleaks, and a 50 percent rise for BlackBasta.It may well be that the resurgence in ransomware attacks, and the rise of these two particular groups, are intimately connected.Why Ransomware Has BouncedResearchers from NCC Group counted 198 successful ransomware campaigns in July \u2013 up 47 percent from June. Sharp as that incline may be, it still falls some ways short of the high-water mark set this Spring, with nearly 300 such campaigns in both March and April.Why the Flux?Well, in May, the United States government ramped up its efforts against Russian cybercrime byofferingup to $15 million for prized information about Conti, then the world\u2019s foremost ransomware gang. \u201cIt is likely that the threat actors that were undergoing structural changes,\u201d the authors of the report speculated, \u201cand have begun settling into their new modes of operating, resulting in their total compromises increasing in conjunction.\u201dHiveleaks and BlackBasta are the result of that restructuring.

Their customers span over 100 countries (including the United States, despite the FCC labeling Hikvision \u201can unacceptable risk to U.S. national security\u201d in 2019).Last Fall, a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras was revealed to the world asCVE-2021-36260. The exploit was given a \u201ccritical\u201d 9.8 out of 10 rating by NIST.Despite the severity of the vulnerability, and nearly a year into this story, over 80,000 affected devices remain unpatched. In the time since, the researchers have discovered \u201cmultiple instances of hackers looking to collaborate on exploiting Hikvision cameras using the command injection vulnerability,\u201d specifically in Russian dark web forums, where leaked credentials have been put up for sale.The extent of the damage done already is unclear. The authors of the report could only speculate that \u201cChinese threat groups such as MISSION2025/APT41, APT10 and its affiliates, as well as unknown Russian threat actor groups could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to fulfill their motives (which may include specific geo-political considerations).\u201dThe Risk in IoT DevicesWith stories like this, it\u2019s easy to ascribe laziness to individuals and organizations that leave their software unpatched. But the story isn\u2019t always so simple.According to David Maynor, senior director of threat intelligence at Cybrary, Hikvision cameras have been vulnerable for many reasons, and for a while. \u201cTheir product contains easy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities or worse, uses default credentials. There is no good way to perform forensics or verify that an attacker has been excised. Furthermore, we have not observed any change in Hikvision\u2019s posture to signal an increase in security within their development cycle.\u201dA lot of the problem is endemic to the industry, not just Hikvision. \u201cIoT devices like cameras aren\u2019t always as easy or straightforward to secure as an app on your phone,\u201d Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech, wrote in a statement via email. \u201cUpdates are not automatic; users need to manually download and install them, and many users might never get the message. Furthermore, IoT devices might not give users any indication that they\u2019re unsecured or out of date. Whereas your phone will alert you when an update is available and likely install it automatically the next time you reboot, IoT devices do not offer such conveniences.\u201dWhile users are none the wiser, cybercriminals can scan for their vulnerable devices with search engines like Shodan or Censys. The problem can certainly be compounded with laziness, as Bischoff noted, \u201cby the fact that Hikvision cameras come with one of a few predetermined passwords out of the box, and many users don\u2019t change these default passwords.\u201dBetween weak security, insufficient visibility and oversight, it\u2019s unclear when or if these tens of thousands of cameras will ever be secured.", "date": "Thu, 25 Aug 2022 18:47:15 +0000", "source": "Threatpost", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "27": {"id": 1, "title": "Palo Alto Networks and SonicWall Firewalls Under Attack", "link": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/palo-alto-networks-sonicwall/", "summary": "Vulnerabilities in firewalls from Palo Alto Networks and SonicWall are currently under active exploitation", "content": null, "date": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:30:00 GMT", "source": "Infosecurity Magazine", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "28": {"id": 1, "title": "Russian Hackers Target Microsoft 365 Accounts with Device Code Phishing", "link": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/russian-microsoft-device-code/", "summary": "Volexity highlighted how Russian nation-state actors are stealing Microsoft device authentication codes to compromise accounts", "content": null, "date": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 14:30:00 GMT", "source": "Infosecurity Magazine", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "29": {"id": 1, "title": "Protesters demonstrate outside Tesla showrooms in US", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/protesters-demonstrate-outside-tesla-showrooms-in-us/", "summary": "CEO Elon Musk the focus of outrage over indiscriminate Trump administration cuts in funding.", "content": "Text\n        settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navProtesters gathered outside Tesla showrooms across the US on Saturday to demonstrate against the drastic cuts Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump, is imposing on the federal government.Organisers cited 37 protests across the country as part of an effort co-ordinated through the social media hashtags #TeslaTakedown and #TeslaTakover.Musk\u2019s car company is emerging as a target for political outrage in the US and Europe in response to the billionaire\u2019s outsized influence in the White House.Through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Musk has orchestrated the dismissal of tens of thousands of civil servants, and gained access to sensitive US Treasury payments. He has also voiced his support for the German far-right and called for the centre-left government of Sir Keir Starmer in the UK to be thrown out.What began with Tesla owners slapping bumper stickers on their cars saying \u201cI bought this before Elon went crazy\u201d has grown to activists projecting an image of Musk making a gesture many have likened to a Nazi salute on to Tesla\u2019s factory in Berlin.The UK campaign group Led by Donkeys joined with Germany\u2019s Centre for Political Beauty in January to project the image, part of a longer montage of Musk\u2019s recent political statements. The group said it was produced in response to the Tesla chief executive\u2019s endorsement of German far-right political party, the AfD.Local news outlets have reported on arson and attempted arson at Tesla showrooms in Oregon and Colorado. Earlier this month a Tesla showroom in The Hague was defaced with graffiti that included swastikas and anti-fascist slogans.Dutch police confirmed to the Financial Times that they were in contact with Tesla and the investigation was continuing, but no arrests had yet been made.Tesla\u2019s stock, which climbed after the presidential election, fell 6 percent on Tuesday to $328.50. It rebounded to close the week at $355.84 but is down 12 percent since the start of the year.\u201cThe worry of the Street is that Musk dedicating so much time\u2014even more than we expected\u2014to Doge takes away from his time at Tesla,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\u201cIn addition, Musk\u2019s Doge-related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand.\u201dAbout 50 to 100 protesters turned out in Portland, Oregon on Saturday, carrying signs saying, \u201cDethrone Musk\u201d and \u201cIf Tesla survives, your country dies.\u201dEdward Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors, was one of them. Since Musk\u2019s power is not derived from election to public office, he said, boycotting and divesting from Tesla is the only tool available to curb his agenda.He argued that Tesla was overvalued and that its core business of making and selling cars was deteriorating. Significant losses could force investors to sell, triggering a drop in the share price and forcing Musk to sell a portion of his shares to meet a margin call.\u201cEvery Tesla sale that you prevent, every dollar not spent servicing a Tesla, not charging at the Supercharger\u2014these further degrade the business,\u201d Niedermeyer said.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not guaranteed, but we do have the opportunity to wipe out a huge amount of Elon Musk\u2019s wealth.\u201dIn Chicago, protesters carried a banner saying \u201cStop buying Nazi cars.\u201dCity resident Lisa Pereira said she came to the demonstration because \u201cyou have to do something.\u201d She said she was disturbed by the administration\u2019s attempts to crush diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, its aggressive immigration enforcement, and the power wielded by Musk.\u201cEverything is a little off the rails,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I decided I had to show up.

Traditional methods of cybersecurity, such as reactive patching and signature-based detection, struggle to keep pace with the dynamic nature of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and kernel-mode rootkits. This white paper introduces a revolutionary approach to cybersecurity: the immunization of the operating system kernel, inspired by biological immune systems.The Problem with Current Cybersecurity MeasuresCurrent cybersecurity solutions often rely on a reactive approach\u2014detecting vulnerabilities after they are exploited and deploying patches to mitigate the damage. This method leaves a critical window of exposure between the discovery of a threat and the application of a fix, during which systems remain vulnerable to attack.Moreover, the sophistication of modern threats, particularly those targeting the kernel, demands a more robust and proactive defense mechanism. Kernel-mode rootkits, in particular, can operate with high levels of privilege, making them difficult to detect and remove without significant system disruption.The Vision: Kernel ImmunizationOur proposed solution is a paradigm shift in cybersecurity: the concept of kernel immunization. By drawing parallels with the human immune system, which can recognize and neutralize pathogens before they cause harm, this approach aims to equip the kernel with the ability to defend itself autonomously against threats.Key Objectives:Immunization Against APTs and Rootkits:By fortifying the kernel against APTs and kernel-mode rootkits, we aim to create a self-defending system that can neutralize threats at their inception.Autonomous Intrusion Defense:The immunized kernel would possess the capability to resist any form of unauthorized intrusion, preventing the installation of malicious programs and ensuring system integrity.Elimination of Patch Dependency:One of the most transformative aspects of kernel immunization is the potential to eliminate the need for traditional patching. This would close the window of vulnerability associated with patch development and deployment, ensuring continuous protection without the risk of data loss or server compromise.The Benefits of Kernel ImmunizationProactive Defense:By immunizing the kernel, systems would no longer rely solely on reactive measures. Instead, they would proactively neutralize threats before they can exploit vulnerabilities.Reduced Downtime:With no need for patching, systems can remain operational and secure without the disruptions typically associated with updates and fixes.Enhanced Security Posture:The kernel\u2019s ability to autonomously defend against the most sophisticated threats would significantly enhance the overall security posture of any organization.ConclusionThe concept of kernel immunization represents a bold step forward in the field of cybersecurity. While still in its conceptual stages, the potential benefits of such an approach are clear: increased resilience, reduced dependency on reactive measures, and a more secure digital environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, so too must our methods of defense. Kernel immunization offers a promising avenue for achieving a future where systems are not only protected but immune to the most dangerous cyber threats.Next StepsThePT SYDECOteam is determined to transform the cybersecurity landscape with this innovative technology and is actively seeking partners and collaborators to realize this vision, further develop and refine this concept.

And some Reddit users are definitely in the \u201cdon't like it\" category. While some subreddits openly welcome AI-generated images, videos, and text, others have responded to the growing trend by banning most or all posts made with the technology.To better understand the reasoning and obstacles associated with these bans, Ars Technica spoke with moderators of subreddits that totally or partially ban generative AI. Almost all these volunteers described moderating against generative AI as a time-consuming challenge they expect to get more difficult as time goes on. And most are hoping that Reddit will release a tool to help their efforts.It's hard to know how much AI-generated content is actually on Reddit, and getting an estimate would be a large undertaking. Image library Freepik hasanalyzedthe use of AI-generated content on social media but leaves Reddit out of its research because \u201cit would take loads of time to manually comb through thousands of threads within the platform,\u201d spokesperson Bella Valentini told me. For its part, Reddit doesn't publicly disclose how many Reddit posts involve generative AI use.To be clear, we're not suggesting that Reddit has a large problem with generative AI use. By now, many subreddits seem to have agreed on their approach to AI-generated posts, and generative AI has not superseded the real, human voices that have made Reddit popular.Still, mods largely agree that generative AI will likely get more popular on Reddit over the next few years, making generative AI modding increasingly important to both moderators and general users. Generative AI's rising popularity has also had implications for Reddit the company, which in 2024 started licensingReddit posts to train the large language models(LLMs) powering generative AI.(Note: All the moderators I spoke with for this story requested that I use their Reddit usernames instead of their real names due to privacy concerns.)No generative AI allowedWhen it comes to anti-generative AI rules, numerous subreddits have zero-tolerance policies, while others permit posts that use generative AI if it's combined with human elements or is executed very well. These rules task mods with identifying posts using generative AI and determining if they fit the criteria to be permitted on the subreddit.Many subreddits have rules against posts made with generative AI because their mod teams or members consider such posts \u201clow effort\u201d or believe AI is counterintuitive to the subreddit\u2019s mission of providing real human expertise and creations.\"At a basic level, generative AI removes the human element from the Internet; if we allowed it, then it would undermine the very point of r/AskHistorians, which is engagement with experts,\" the mods of r/AskHistorians told me in a collective statement.The subreddit's goal is to provide historical information, and its mods think generative AI could make information shared on the subreddit less accurate. \"[Generative AI] is likely to hallucinate facts, generate non-existent references, or otherwise provide misleading content,\" the mods said. \"Someone getting answers from an LLM can\u2019t respond to follow-ups because they aren\u2019t an expert. We have built a reputation as a reliable source of historical information, and the use of [generative AI], especially without oversight, puts that at risk.\"Similarly, Halaku, a mod of r/wheeloftime, told me that the subreddit's mods banned generative AI because \u201cwe focus on genuine discussion.\u201d Halaku believes AI content can\u2019t facilitate \u201corganic, genuine discussion\u201d and \u201ccan drown out actual artwork being done by actual artists.\u201dThe r/lego subreddit banned AI-generated art because it caused confusion in online fan communities and retail stores selling Lego products, r/lego mod Mescad said. \u201cPeople would see AI-generated art that looked like Lego on [I]nstagram or [F]acebook and then go into the store to ask to buy it,\u201d they explained. \u201cWe decided that our community's dedication to authentic Lego products doesn't include AI-generated art.\u201dNot all of Reddit is against generative AI, of course.Subreddits dedicated to the technologyexist, and some general subreddits permit the use of generative AI in some or all forms.\"When it comes to bans, I would rather focus on hate speech, Nazi salutes, and things that actually harm the subreddits,\" said 3rdusernameiveused, who moderates r/consoom and r/TeamBuilder25, which don't ban generative AI. \"AI art does not do that... If I was going to ban [something] for 'moral' reasons, it probably won\u2019t be AI art.\"\u201cOverwhelmingly low-effort slop\u201dSome generative AI bans are reflective of concerns that people are not being properly compensated for the content they create, which is then fed into LLM training.Mod Mathgeek007 told me that r/DeadlockTheGame bans generative AI because its members consider it \u201ca form of uncredited theft,\" adding:You aren't allowed to sell/advertise the workers of others, and AI in a sense is using patterns derived from the work of others to create mockeries. I'd personally have less of an issue with it if the artists involved were credited and compensated\u2014and there are some niche AI tools that do this.Other moderators simply think generative AI reduces the quality of a subreddit's content.\"It often just doesn't look good... the art can often look subpar,\" Mathgeek007 said.Similarly, r/videos bans most AI-generated content because, according to itsannouncement, the videos are \u201cannoying\u201d and \u201cjust bad video\u201d 99 percent of the time. In an online interview, r/videos mod Abrownn told me:It's overwhelmingly low-effort slop thrown together simply for views/ad revenue. The creators rarely care enough to put real effort into post-generation [or] editing of the content [and] rarely have coherent narratives [in] the videos, etc. It seems like they just throw the generated content into a video, export it, and call it a day.An r/fakemon mod told me, \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more low-effort in terms of art creation than just typing words and having it generated for you.\"Some moderators say generative AI helps people spam unwanted content on a subreddit, including posts that are irrelevant to the subreddit and posts that attack users.\"[Generative AI] content is almost entirely posted for purely self promotional/monetary reasons, and we as mods on Reddit are constantly dealing with abusive users just spamming their content without regard for the rules,\" Abrownn said.A moderator of the r/wallpaper subreddit, which permits generative AI, disagrees. The mod told me that generative AI \"provides new routes for novel content\" in the subreddit and questioned concerns about generative AI stealing from human artists or offering lower-quality work, saying those problems aren't unique to generative AI:Even in our community, we observe human-generated content that is subjectively low quality (poor camera/[P]hotoshopping skills, low-resolution source material, intentional \"shitposting\"). It can be argued that AI-generated content amplifies this behavior, but our experience (which we haven't quantified) is that the rate of such behavior (whether human-generated or AI-generated content) has not changed much within our own community.But we're not a very active community\u2014[about] 13 posts per day ... so it very well could be a \"frog in boiling water\" situation.Generative AI \u201cwastes our time\u201dMany mods are confident in their ability to effectively identify posts that use generative AI. A bigger problem is how much time it takes to identify these posts and remove them.The r/AskHistorians mods, for example, noted that all bans on the subreddit (including bans unrelated to AI) have \u201can appeals process,\u201d and \u201cmaking these assessments and reviewing AI appeals means we\u2019re spending a considerable amount of time on something we didn\u2019t have to worry about a few years ago.\u201dThey added:Frankly, the biggest challenge with [generative AI] usage is that it wastes our time. The time spent evaluating responses for AI use, responding to AI evangelists who try to flood our subreddit with inaccurate slop and then argue with us in modmail, [direct messages that message a subreddits\u2019 mod team], and discussing edge cases could better be spent on other subreddit projects, like our podcast, newsletter, and AMAs, \u2026 providing feedback to users, or moderating input from users who intend to positively contribute to the community.Several other mods I spoke with agree. Mathgeek007, for example, named \"fighting AI bros\" as a common obstacle. And for r/wheeloftime moderator Halaku, the biggest challenge in moderating against generative AI is \u201ca generational one.\u201d\u201cSome of the current generation don't have a problem with it being AI because content is content, and [they think] we're being elitist by arguing otherwise, and they want to argue about it,\u201d they said.A couple of mods noted that it\u2019s less time-consuming to moderate subreddits that ban generative AI than it is to moderate those that allow posts using generative AI, depending on the context.\u201cOn subreddits where we allowed AI, I often take a bit longer time to actually go into each post where I feel like... it\u2019s been AI-generated to actually look at it and make a decision,\u201d explained N3DSdude, a mod of several subreddits with rules against generative AI, including r/DeadlockTheGame.MyarinTime, a moderator for r/lewdgames, which allows generative AI images, highlighted the challenges of identifying human-prompted generative AI content versus AI-generated content prompted by a bot:When the AI bomb started, most of those bots started using AI content to work around our filters. Most of those bots started showing some random AI render, so it looks like you're actually talking about a game when you're not. There's no way to know when those posts are legit games unless [you check] them one by one. I honestly believe it would be easier if we kick any post with [AI-]generated image... instead of checking if a button was pressed by a human or not.Mods expect things to get worseMost mods told me it\u2019s pretty easy for them to detect posts made with generative AI, pointing to the distinct tone and favored phrases of AI-generated text. A few said that AI-generated video is harder to spot but still detectable. But as generative AI gets more advanced, moderators are expecting their work to get harder.In a joint statement, r/dune mods Blue_Three and Herbalhippie said, \u201cAI used to have a problem making hands\u2014i.e., too many fingers, etc.\u2014but as time goes on, this is less and less of an issue.\u201dR/videos' Abrownn also wonders how easy it will be to detect AI-generated Reddit content \u201cas AI tools advance and content becomes more lifelike.\u201dMathgeek007 added:AI is becoming tougher to spot and is being propagated at a larger rate. When AI style becomes normalized, it becomes tougher to fight. I expect generative AI to get significantly worse\u2014until it becomes indistinguishable from ordinary art.Moderators currently use various methods to fight generative AI, but they're not perfect. r/AskHistorians mods, for example, use \u201cAI detectors, which are unreliable, problematic, and sometimes require paid subscriptions, as well as our own ability to detect AI through experience and expertise,\u201d while N3DSdude pointed to tools like Quid and GPTZero.To manage current and future work around blocking generative AI, most of the mods I spoke with said they\u2019d like Reddit to release a proprietary tool to help them.\u201cI've yet to see a reliable tool that can detect AI-generated video content,\u201d Aabrown said. \u201cEven if we did have such a tool, we'd be putting hundreds of hours of content through the tool daily, which would get rather expensive rather quickly. And we're unpaid volunteer moderators, so we will be outgunned shortly when it comes to detecting this type of content at scale. We can only hope that Reddit will offer us a tool at some point in the near future that can help deal with this issue.\u201dA Reddit spokesperson told me that the company is evaluating what such a tool could look like. But Reddit doesn\u2019t have a rule banning generative AI overall, and the spokesperson said the company doesn't want to release a tool that would hinder expression or creativity.For now, Reddit seems content to rely on moderators to remove AI-generated content when appropriate. Reddit's spokesperson added:Our moderation approach helps ensure that content on Reddit is curated by real humans. Moderators are quick to remove content that doesn't follow community rules, including harmful or irrelevant AI-generated content\u2014we don't see this changing in the near future.Making a generative AI Reddit tool wouldn\u2019t be easyReddit is handling the evolving concerns around generative AI as it has handled other content issues, including by leveraging AI and machine learning tools. Reddit's spokesperson said that this includes testing tools that can identify AI-generated media, such as images of politicians.But making a proprietary tool that allows moderators to detect AI-generated posts won't be easy, if it happens at all. The current tools for detecting generative AI are limited in their capabilities, and as generative AI advances, Reddit would need to provide tools that are more advanced than the AI-detecting tools that are currently available.That would require a good deal of technical resources and would also likely present notable economic challenges for the social media platform, which onlybecame profitable last year. And as noted by r/videos moderator Abrownn, tools for detecting AI-generated video still have a long way to go, making a Reddit-specific system especially challenging to create.But even with a hypothetical Reddit tool, moderators would still have their work cut out for them. And because Reddit's popularity is largely due to its content from real humans, that work is important.Since Reddit's inception, that has meant relying on moderators, which Reddit has said it intends to keep doing. As r/dune modsBlue_Threeand herbalhippie put it, it\u2019s in Reddit\u2019s \u201cbest interest that much/most content remains organic in nature.\" After all, Reddit's profitability has a lot to do with how much AI companies are willing to pay to access Reddit data. That value would likely decline if Reddit posts became largely AI-generated themselves.But providing the technology to ensure that generative AI isn't abused on Reddit would be a large challege. For now, volunteer laborers will continue to bear the brunt of generative AI moderation.Advance Publications, which owns Ars Technica parent Cond\u00e9 Nast, is the largest shareholder of Reddit.Scharon HardingSenior Technology ReporterScharon HardingSenior Technology ReporterScharon is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer gadgets and services.

I demonstrated how many information security professionals struggled to manage all the aspects needed to create effective policies and processes. The conclusion I sought to highlight was that this problem is mainly due to an excessively narrow approach to the organization and its usual resources.Reflecting on what it would be like to run your company without your most important data or, worse still, imagining that all this information could fall into the wrong hands seemed, although obvious, quite alarming. Unfortunately, this uncomfortable reality has become all too common, where data leaks, cyber-attacks, secret breaches, and industrial espionage are frequently reported in the media. At one extreme, threats to national security, such as cyber-warfare, have also further underscored the urgent need for data protection.Faced with this not-so-new scenario of growing risks, organizational structures need to constantly reinvent themselves. Just a decade ago, the CSO (Chief Security Officer) role was primarily responsible for physical security measures, such as securing facilities, managing personnel security, and overseeing emergency preparedness. Today, the CSO\u2019s role has evolved to include new responsibilities, such as enterprise risk management. CSOs are now expected to understand, mitigate, and stay ahead of a wide range of risks, including cyber, physical, operational, and reputational risks. Thus, we can say that this professional has gained, in addition to many new concerns and responsibilities, a new letter to their title: The traditional CSO has been transformed into a new, revamped, and now even busier CISO (Chief Information Security Officer).The CISO got the Old Maid card.As with many other management positions, the CISO is also the professional responsible for determining the cost vs. benefit ratios of the investments that will be made in the information security area, more specifically, the security and risks vs. the viability of the costs/investments. Obviously, for these decisions, evaluation is crucial, as excessive or misdirected action can derail remediation efforts.At the same time, the world is committed to seeking solutions for guaranteeing the security triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, aka C.I.A.). Numerous regulatory bodies have implemented security norms and standards, such as PCI-DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, and HIPAA, as well as legislation such as the GDPR.CISO \u2013 Compliance and legislation.As the graph below shows, the types of vulnerabilities recorded over the years continue to be concentrated in very similar main categories. However, the number of occurrences has increased due to the expansion of attack surfaces.OWASP Rank for Weaknesses by Year \u2013 F5 Labs.Information such as above highlights the critical importance of analysis and tools for a CISO. These tools are essential for improving and updating logical and physical control mechanisms, helping to reduce the risks associated with vulnerabilities that have already been identified and included in organizations\u2019 policies.However, it seems that the \u201ccorrective glasses used\u201d now by the new CISO are often not enough to overcome the chronic myopia that plagues the position because the fundamental problem remains unchanged: The constructive process by which companies continue to develop and structure their security policies still uses an \u201cinbox\u201d view that is an internal perspective and, therefore, limited in scope. This \u201capproach\u201d was not, is not, and is unlikely to be sufficient to cover the full range of vulnerabilities in the company.Companies must consider a new approach since only those who don\u2019t experience the day-to-day running of the organization can get far enough away from the heart of the problem to see it from another perspective. As long as CISOs try to base security policies exclusively on their knowledge of the organization and their usual resources, it\u2019s improbable that these policies will cover all possible and imaginable gaps. Supported by these policies, many institutions become prisoners of their pseudo-security.This is the CISO\u2019s myopia: believing that building a 100% \u201cmade in company\u201d policy can be enough to control all security aspects. This myopia ignores that criminals don\u2019t follow the CISO\u2019s rules and policies; they think differently and have different experiences, and, at the end of the day, it\u2019s many against few.CISO \u2013 \u201cinbox\u201d view.In this way, the CISO significantly increases the risk of controlling only the aspects covered by this \u201cinbox\u201d view without considering many other real and unforeseen threats that may go beyond their security measures.The limitation of relying exclusively on the internal policies and knowledge of the CISO and their team highlights the need for an external and specialized perspective to strengthen organizations\u2019 security. Specialized professionals and companies can offer more impartial, less biased views.Pentest services, for example, allow companies to simulate real attacks on your environment, testing the effectiveness of security measures under adverse conditions. Since criminals don\u2019t follow the rules established by internal policies, pentesters imitate behaviors and attack techniques real criminals use. This helps to identify weaknesses that could be exploited by external attackers, who operate outside the limits imposed by the company\u2019s security policy and often outside the law.The incorporation of an \u201coutbox\u201d perspective to alleviate problems rooted in the usual \u201cinbox\u201d view, whether in supporting the construction and updating of internal policies or in expanding the knowledge base for consolidating defenses, can help remedy this dangerous myopia that we have been discussing for years.About the AuthorJordan Bonagura Principal Security Researcher | Information Security Consultant | Cybersecurity Specialist | Professor | Speaker.If you have any further questions feel free to reach out to him at[email\u00a0protected]or you can find him onLinkedIn.", "date": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:00:01 +0000", "source": "Cyber Defense Magazine", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "34": {"id": 1, "title": "The Multi-Layer Complexity of Cybersecurity for The Automotive Supply Chain", "link": "https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/the-multi-layer-complexity-of-cybersecurity-for-the-automotive-supply-chain/", "summary": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/The-Multi-Layer-Complexity-of-Cybersecurity-for-the-Automotive-Supply-Chain.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;\" width=\"1024\" /><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/The-Multi-Layer-Complexity-of-Cybersecurity-for-the-Automotive-Supply-Chain.jpg\" width=\"128\" />Thousands and thousands of components go into the assembly of contemporary vehicles.

It is impossible for any original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to produce all these components themselves. The demand for just-in-time delivery and customization for all these parts has created a huge, unusually integrated supply chain.If even one supplier experiences a cybersecurity breach, the impact can be exponentially damaging for the automotive industry. The weeks of plant downtime not only cause huge production losses for that supplier, but it also creates a ripple effect impacting production and supplier relations further down the chain. Not to mention, the entire supply chain could be exposed to a devastating cyberattack. Most important of all is the potential to jeopardize human safety.Unfortunately, there are gaps in operational technology (OT) cybersecurity that are growing more common in the manufacturing process of the automotive supply chain. The introduction of increasingly innovative and powerful systems in the plants, as well as more connectivity across and beyond the vehicles themselves, is widening the gaps.Plant and security managers are often stunned to discover the range of vulnerabilities that exist under their watch. What actionable steps can they take to make definitive and quick progress in closing the gaps and ensuring protection from supply chain threats?Automotive manufacturers cannot afford to be merely responsive to cybersecurity events or new regulations that come their way. They need a proactive and practical approach forward to ensure uninterrupted operations and revenues.Surprisingly Common Security GapsThe OT environments for most companies in the supply chain are complex and untouchable with a mentality of \u201cif it isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d Many of today\u2019s automotive plants contain a variety of hardware and software systems with widely differing ages, operating systems (OSs), and capabilities.For example, some of the robotic technologies that are being installed in the plants are among the most modern and innovative industrial control systems (ICSs) found in any manufacturing sector globally. They rely on new OSs, which require different patching and firmware levels.Step over to the next production line in the same plant, and it\u2019s common to find assets that are decades old. While such a legacy system could be critical for the manufacturing process, it might still be running an old OS that is no longer being updated or patched by its vendor.Responsibility for OT maintenance and cybersecurity in the manufacturing process of the automotive supply chain usually falls to traditional information technology (IT) network or OS support. As a result, there is often literally no one who is directly responsible for what is getting plugged into the OT network on the floor. Furthermore, because there is not often a strong relationship between the different worlds, very minimal OT knowledge resides on the IT side of expertise, or vice versa.The automotive manufacturer is often under the dangerous misperception that both its IT and OT networks are being secured\u2014when, in fact, the company does not have nearly the visibility to protect its own OT processes, much less those of its connected vendors and partners. Indeed, it is usually an OEM\u2019s Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers whom cyber attackers target in the automotive industry.Actionable Steps to Seize ControlHow can an automotive manufacturer gain visibility across its OT landscape and begin to put in place practical and effective processes? The good news is that there are key strides that can be made in short order to get out in front of the evolving challenges that they will face in the months and years ahead:Walk the plant floor and open the cabinets\u2014The first step is often the most eye-opening. Plant personnel and support vendors will do what they need to do in order to get a system up, running and connected, including remote access points. Often, in the wake of that process, there are wide-open, unsecured internet connections left behind into the manufacturer\u2019s network.Shore up and lock down\u2014It is crucial to adopt a solid security practice around the maintenance routine across the asset lifecycle of existing equipment and to make sure that there are safe mechanisms for secure file transfer. When they do not have remote access, vendors often bring in unsecure USB sticks to load code or software patches on their equipment. Tightening perimeter security and, as necessary, locking down OT endpoints is a key second step.Prioritize the most vulnerable and meaningful gaps\u2014The OT networks in the automotive supply chain are typically flat. A cyber attack on one system often can impact other plants and systems across the network of suppliers and partners. Automotive manufacturers must assess the potential harm of various threats\u2014i.e., if Machine X goes down or Process Y fails, what is the risk of a downward cycle?\u2014and prioritize actions such as network segmentation that would do the most to mitigate damage across the supply chain.The question is not whether it\u2019s necessary to strengthen OT cybersecurity in automotive manufacturing\u2014rather, it\u2019s how and where to get started. Plant and security managers cannot afford to be stymied by the complexity and scope of the clear challenges facing them and wait for new events or regulations to force their hands. There are practical, low-risk steps to be taken today in getting started, and they can enable automotive manufacturers to very quickly realize value in an investment in OT cybersecurity.About the AuthorAs Technical Director, Americas atTXOne Networks, Austen Byers leads the company\u2019s efforts in providing design, architecture, and engineering technical direction and leadership.Austen is a sought-after thought leader in operational technology (OT) cybersecurity with more than 10 years in the cybersecurity space.

The Chinese Chang\u2019e-6 lander planted a flag, dug up more than four pounds of rock and soil, and brought it back home\u2014an accomplishment widely lauded as a technological tour de force.That mission, and the 2020 Chang\u2019e-5 robotic mission before it, are the first to return lunar rocks to Earth since the 1970s. Together they are building on what scientists learned from Apollo-era missions, helping to unravel mysteries about how the Moon was formed and why it looks the way it does today, and providing clues about our solar system\u2019s history.But big puzzles remain, such as why the far side of the Moon\u2014the half that always faces away from Earth\u2014is so radically different from the near side. And what is behind the surprising finding that lunar volcanoes may have been active much more recently than previously thought? \u201cThe more we look at the Moon, the more we\u2019ve discovered\u2014and the more we realize how little we know,\u201d says Clive R. Neal, a geologist at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in lunar exploration.China\u2019s 2024 Chang\u2019e-6 robotic lander mission brought more than four pounds of rocks from the far side of the Moon back to Earth.Credit:CNSA / CASWith NASA planning to send astronauts back to the Moon\u2019s surface in 2027 for the first time since 1972, geologists are excited about what rocks they might find there and the scientific secrets those samples could reveal\u2014along with what resources could be mined for a future Moon base, or for renewable energy back home on Earth.Origin storyThe samples brought home from the Moon in the 1970s by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Union\u2019s Luna missions cleared up quite a lot about theMoon\u2019s history. Because the lunar samples shared strong similarities with Earth rocks, this added weight to the idea that the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized object called Theia collided with the proto-Earth roughly4.5 billion years ago.Debris from the impact was thrown into orbit around Earth and eventually coalesced into the Moon. In its early days, the Moon was entirely molten. As the magma ocean cooled over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon formed a crust and a mantle below. Giant pools of lava filled impact craters and settled into the lunar lowlands, or maria (Latin for \u201cseas\u201d), while highlands and volcanic domes loomed above them. Eventually, the volcanism died out.Without plate tectonics or weather, the only things left to alter the Moon\u2019s cold, dead surface were meteorites. A lot of the Apollo-era samples were found to have formed from the heat and pressure of impacts around 3.9 billion years ago, suggesting that they were the result of a short period of intense pummeling by space rocks called the Late Heavy Bombardment.But research since the 1970s has refined or changed this picture. Higher-resolution orbital images have revealed plenty of large impact craters that seem far older than 3.9 billion years, for example. And meteorites found on Earth, thought to have been ejected from various areas of the Moon during big impacts, have been found to span a huge range of ages.All this work together suggeststhat the asteroid bombardment didn\u2019t happen in one dramatic spike but rather over an extended period lasting from perhaps 4.2 billion to 3.4 billion years ago. In this scenario, the Apollo samples dated to 3.9 billion years likely all came from just one huge impact that spewed rock over a very wide area that happened to include the Apollo-era landing sites.The Moon: Dead or aliveGreater mysteries surround volcanism on the Moon. \u201cThe canonical thing I learned in school was that the Moon had been geologically dead for billions of years,\u201d says Samuel Lawrence, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston.The long-held theory was that a small body like the Moon should have lost its heat to space relatively quickly\u2014and a frigid, extinguished Moon shouldn\u2019t have widespread volcanic activity. Apollo-era samples suggested that most of this volcanism stopped 3 billion years ago or earlier, supporting the theory. But research over the past two decades has overturned that view.This geologic map of the Moon released in 2022 by China is the most detailed global map yet published and includes information gleaned from the 2020 Chang\u2019e-5 mission.Credit:J. JI ET AL / THE 1:2,500,000-SCALE GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE GLOBAL MOON 2022.In 2014, Lawrence and colleagues posited that some patches of irregular terrain in the middle of the dark plains, or mare, spotted by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were the result of volcanism that kept going untilless than 100 million years ago. \u201cThat is totally, totally surprising,\u201d says cosmochemist Qing-Zhu Yin of the University of California, Davis.The latest sample-return missions added more concrete evidence for recent volcanism. In 2020, the Chang\u2019e-5 robotic mission landed in Oceanus Procellarum (the Ocean of Storms) \u2014 a spot picked in part because it looked geologically young given how few craters had accumulated there. Sure enough, the volcanic rocks brought home by that mission were found to be2 billion years old, the youngest ever retrieved from the Moon. \u201cThat was big news,\u201d says planetary geoscientist Jim Head of Brown University, who worked on NASA\u2019s Apollo missions.On top of this, when researchers trawled through thousands of glass beads found in the Chang\u2019e-5 soil samples, most of which are thought to have been created by impacts, they identified three that were volcanic\u2014and only120 million years old. This finding was published just last year and still needs to be verified, but if such recent dates hold up, they suggest that the Moon mightstill be capable of producing deep magma even today, Yin says.All this indicates that the Moon might not have cooled as fast as everyone thought it did. It\u2019s also possible that some of the younger volcanism could have been powered by radioactive elements underground, which can generate enough heat to form magma and are known to be prevalent in certain patches of the Moon. This could explain the 120-million-year-old volcanic glass beads, for example. But not all the early volcanism can be explained this way: The Chang\u2019e-5 volcanic rocks, along with some 2.8-billion-year-old volcanic rock brought back from the far side by Chang\u2019e-6, came from source rocksnotenriched with these elements.\u201cIt throws up more questions than it answers,\u201d Neal says. \u201cIt\u2019s job security for people like me \u2014 we now have new questions to address.\u201dLunar exploration aheadUntangling these mysteries is challenging with so much of the Moon unexplored: While about 850 pounds of Moon rock and soil have now been brought back to Earth, it has all been from just a handful of sites.Chang\u2019e-6 expanded this picture by bringing back the first samples from the Moon\u2019s far side, taken from the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the satellite\u2019s largest, deepest and oldest impact crater. Researchers are keen to use these samples to start determining why the far side is so dramatically different from the near side. The questions that remain unanswered are why the far side has a thicker crust and is nearly devoid of mare from ancient lava oceans when compared with the near side.NASA\u2019s Artemis III mission, planned for 2027 (though that couldchange), aims to break more new ground by landing astronauts near the Moon\u2019s south pole\u2014in a spot that is more representative of the Moon\u2019s typical geology than the Apollo sites\u2014and bring home a bonanza of 150 to 180 pounds of samples.This site should provide fresh geological insights, along with more information about lunar water. In 2018, scientists analyzing orbital mapping dataconfirmed that there is water iceat the poles\u2014but in what form no one yet knows. \u201cIs it frost on the surface? Is it discrete patches underneath the surface? Is it absorbed onto mineral grains? Is it baked into the regolith like cement?\u201d says NASA\u2019s Juliane Gross, who is helping to develop the plans for lunar sample collection and curation for the Artemis science team. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201dWhat the Artemis astronauts find could inform ongoing projects spearheaded by China and the United States to establish permanent bases on the Moon, which could benefit from the south pole\u2019s water. \u201cThat\u2019s stuff you can breathe, that\u2019s stuff you can drink, it\u2019srocket fuel,\u201d Lawrence says.Lunar quarryIn addition to water ice, other potentially mineable resources on the Moon have garnered attention, particularlyhelium-3. This stable isotope of helium is far more plentiful on the Moon than on Earth and could be an ideal fuel fornuclear fusion(if physicists can get that process to work). Commercial enterprises seeking to mine the Moon have popped up, including Seattle-basedInterlune, which plans to bring helium-3 back to Earth in the 2030s, followed by other resources such as rare earth elements needed for technologies like batteries. But when lunar mining will be a reality\u2014considering the logistics, the economics and the legal concerns\u2014is an open question, Lawrence says.While some people find the idea of mining the pristine Moon distasteful, there could be side benefits for mining on Earth, Neal says. With polar temperatures around -230\u00b0 C (-380\u00b0 F), lunar mining would have to be done without fluids. Developing the technologies needed for fluid-free mining could mitigate environmental concerns about wastewater and tailing fluids from mining on Earth. \u201cJust think how you could revolutionize mining on this planet,\u201d he says.But first, researchers need to simply find out more about the Moon, its history, its geology and the possibility of extracting resources\u2014and that requires up-close exploration, which is sure to bring more surprises. \u201cOnce you\u2019re on the ground, you\u2019re like, oh \u2026 what\u2019s this?\u201d Gross says. She\u2019s hoping the astronauts can bring home a large haul. \u201cThe more they return, the more we can do.\u201dThis article originally appeared inKnowable Magazine, a nonprofit publication dedicated to making scientific knowledge accessible to all.Sign up for\u00a0Knowable Magazine\u2019s newsletter.Knowable MagazineKnowable MagazineKnowable Magazine explores the real-world significance of scholarly work through a journalistic lens.77 Comments", "date": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 12:03:47 +0000", "source": "Ars Technica Security", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "36": {"id": 1, "title": "How Amazon Prime Day Scams Are Getting Smarter and How Can You Protect Yourself", "link": "https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/how-amazon-prime-day-scams-are-getting-smarter-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself/", "summary": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-Amazon-Prime-Day-Scams-Are-Getting-Smarter-and-How-Can-You-Protect-Yourself.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;\" width=\"1024\" /><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-Amazon-Prime-Day-Scams-Are-Getting-Smarter-and-How-Can-You-Protect-Yourself.jpg\" width=\"128\" />Amazon Prime Day has become a major shopping event, with 2023 setting a record as customers purchased over 375 million items worldwide, up from 300 million in 2022.

As more people rush to find deals, scammers are using increasingly advanced tactics to exploit unsuspecting consumers.What\u2019s Different This Year?The use of AI has significantly changed how scams are created and deployed. Tools like ChatGPT have seen explosive growth, reaching 100 million users in the first couple of months after launch \u2014 the fastest-growing consumer application in history. This widespread use of AI tools allows scammers to craft highly convincing emails, fake websites, tones of voice and even deepfake videos that closely mimic legitimate communications. In the first half of 2024 alone, there has been a notable increase in AI-powered scams, such as voice cloning and deepfakes, which impersonate trusted organizations or individuals with unprecedented accuracy.And it\u2019s not just about mimicking Amazon anymore. Scammers are expanding their targets to include other trusted names such as USPS, Temu and SHEIN. With 54% of Prime Day shoppers comparing prices across multiple retailers before purchasing, scammers see an opportunity to deceive across different platforms, knowing that consumers are less suspicious when they recognize a brand.Amazon\u2019s Package Volume and USPS\u2019s Role:Amazon\u2019s logistics operations have expanded significantly, and in 2023, the company surpassed UPS in U.S. parcel volume, marking a major shift in the delivery landscape. Despite Amazon\u2019s growing in-house capabilities, it still relies heavily on USPS for a substantial portion of its deliveries, especially for last-mile services. USPS handled millions of Amazon packages, particularly in rural and remote areas, where its delivery network reaches every address in the U.S. In 2023, U.S. parcel volumes reached 21.65 billion shipments, with USPS playing a crucial role in handling a significant portion of these parcels.Given USPS\u2019s extensive involvement in deliveries, it has become a prime target for scammers. In Q1 and Q2 of 2024, USPS was one of the most frequently imitated brands in phishing scams, as scammers created fake notifications and impersonated its services to trick consumers. Scammers have used this association to craft phishing emails that look like official USPS notifications, including fake tracking updates or delivery failure alerts, exploiting the trust consumers have in USPS.What Can the Public Do About It?Traditional Methods Aren\u2019t Enough:Hovering over a link or checking the sender\u2019s email might have been enough in the past, but today\u2019s AI-powered scams are designed to bypass these simple checks. Fake websites can appear high in search engine rankings, so searching for a company\u2019s name directly might still lead you to a scam.Take Safer Actions:The safest way to check your orders or get customer support is through the official app or by typing the URL directly into your browser. Avoid clicking on links from emails or text messages, even if they appear to come from a trusted source. Scammers are skilled at creating urgency to make you click without thinking.Utilize Advanced Security Tools:As the human eye is no longer sufficient to detect today\u2019s sophisticated scams, security tools that provide real-time protection can help detect phishing attempts, block malicious websites and warn you about potential scams before they reach people. As scammers continue to evolve their tactics with AI, having this extra layer of security is crucial.The reality is simple: as scams become more sophisticated, so must the public\u2019s defenses.About the AuthorEfrat Tabibi is the Head of Data Science and Analytics at Guardio.

At its core lies a fundamental paradox: the more tools we deploy to protect our digital assets, the more complex and vulnerable our security posture becomes. This is a challenge faced by security teams worldwide, but it\u2019s particularly acute for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).The average CISO juggles a staggering array of security tools \u2013 often more than 75 \u2013 sourced from a multitude of vendors. Each tool comes with its own unique management interface, update schedule, and potential vulnerabilities. This creates a patchwork quilt of security, where gaps can easily emerge, and threats can slip through undetected. The complexity inherent in managing this sprawling toolset is a significant drain on resources, hindering the team\u2019s ability to focus on strategic initiatives and proactive threat hunting.Studies show that the average number of security tools deployed by organizations has increased by 30% in the past 3 years. This proliferation of tools has led to a corresponding increase in security complexity and operational costs.Moreover, the different patching and replacement cycles associated with these tools introduce another layer of complexity. Ensuring that all tools are up-to-date with the latest security patches is a daunting task, requiring meticulous planning and coordination. A single overlooked patch can become a critical vulnerability, inviting cybercriminals to exploit the gap.This overreliance on such a wide array of tools is counterintuitive to the goal of creating a secure environment. It can inadvertently increase risk. The more tools in place, the greater the likelihood of overlapping functionalities, redundant efforts, and increased operational costs. Additionally, the sheer volume of alerts generated by these tools can lead to alert fatigue, desensitizing security teams to genuine threats.Experience tells us that a significant amount of security alerts are false positives, leading to wasted time and resources. This highlights the challenge of managing the sheer volume of data generated by modern security tools.Recognizing this issue, CISOs are increasingly prioritizing consolidation. The trend is clear: fewer vendors, better security. This shift is driven by the desire to simplify operations, reduce costs, and improve overall security posture. However, this is not a new aspiration. IT and security teams have long sought to streamline their toolsets, but the technology simply hasn\u2019t been mature enough to support such a consolidation.The tide is finally turning. Advances in technology, particularly in the areas of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and automation, are making it possible to achieve the long-sought-after goal of a consolidated security stack. Cloud-based platforms offer the scalability and flexibility needed to integrate disparate security functions into a unified solution. AI and automation can streamline processes, reduce manual intervention, and improve threat detection capabilities.Forrester has predicted that by 2025, 50% of organizations will have adopted a consolidated security platform. This trend is being driven by the increasing complexity of the threat landscape and the need for more efficient and effective security operations.Zero trust architecture is another key driver of this trend. By shifting the security perimeter from the network to the individual user, zero trust necessitates a more centralized and integrated approach to security. This architectural shift aligns perfectly with the goal of consolidating security tools. By adopting a zero trust framework, organizations can reduce their reliance on traditional perimeter-based security controls and replace them with more granular, identity-centric protections.In conclusion, the complexity of modern security environments is a major obstacle to effective threat management. CISOs are leading the charge in addressing this challenge by consolidating their toolsets and moving towards fewer vendors.While this has been a long-standing desire, recent technological advancements are finally making it a reality. By simplifying their security stacks and embracing emerging technologies like cloud, AI, and zero trust, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture and better protect their valuable assets.About the AuthorJaye Tillson, Field CTO and Distinguished Technologist \u2013 Security at HPE, brings over 25 years of invaluable expertise in successfully implementing strategic global technology programs.

But maybe not for long.Priester\u2019s Pecans, an Alabama staple, is one of more than half a dozen sites across the state slated to receive millions of dollars in federal funding to expand access to chargers for electric vehicles.Across the country, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law under then-President Joe Biden, is set to provide $5 billion to states for projects that expand the nation\u2019s EV charging infrastructure.But in aFebruary 6 letter, a Trump administration official notified state directors of transportation that, effectively, they can\u2019t spend it. The Federal Highway Administration rescinded guidance on the funds, which had been allocated by Congress, and \u201cis also immediately suspending the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment plans for all fiscal years,\u201d the letter said.\u201cTherefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new State plans are submitted and approved.\u201dPOLITICOreportedon Wednesday that a DOT spokesman said in an email that states were free to use a small portion of the funding\u2014about $400 million\u2014because that was money the states had already \u201cobligated,\u201d or awarded to subcontractors. But that would still leave close to 90 percent of the funding up in the air.Even before the administration had issued its letter, some Republican-led states, including Alabama, had already announced pauses to their states\u2019 implementation of the national EV charging program.\u201cIn response to Unleashing American Energy, one of several Executive Orders that President Trump signed on January 20, 2025, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs has paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program as of January 28, 2025,\u201d the Alabama agency responsible for implementing NEVI posted on its website. \u201cIn addition, for applications for funding that were originally due on March 17, 2025, ADECA has closed the application window until further notice.\u201dDespite the announcement by the Trump administration, however, legal experts and those familiar with the electric charging program at issue say the president does not have the power to permanently nix the NEVI program.\u201cNEVI funding was appropriated by Congress as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law, and it cannot be canceled by the executive branch,\u201d said Elizabeth Turnbull, director of policy and regulatory affairs at the Alliance for Transportation Electrification, a trade group for the electric vehicle industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the secretary of transportation has the authority to revoke states\u2019 NEVI plans, and it\u2019s quite clear that the executive branch lacks the authority to withhold the funding for any sustained period. So, we expect recent executive branch actions to be successfully challenged in court.\u201dEven under the most aggressive arguments for a strong executive branch, the Supreme Court has stated clearly that the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to appropriate and legislate.Lawmakers, too, have weighed in on the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s NEVI directive, saying officials acted with\u201cblatant disregard for the law.\u201dIn a letter to administration officials, Democratic members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works urged the Department of Transportation to retract its February 6 letter and \u201cimplement the law according to your responsibilities.\u201dCredit:Lee Hedgepeth/ Inside Climate NewsThe Democrats\u2019 letter also asked for responses to questions about the legal basis for the action and for information about the involvement of individuals associated with Elon Musk\u2019s so-called \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency.\u201d DOGE is not an official department, and multiple reports show that Musk\u2019s team has beendismantlingparts or all ofsome federal agencies.Tesla, Musk\u2019s electric vehicle company, currently has the largest network of fast chargers in the country. It\u2019s not yet clear if any new policies on NEVI, or the pause on building out a more robust network for all EV drivers, could benefit Tesla.The Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s parent agency, did not respond to a request for comment.With or without NEVI, the move toward the electrification of transportation is inevitable, experts say. But they warn that although the administration\u2019s pause of the program will likely be reversed by the courts, even a temporary delay in EV charging infrastructure can harm the nation\u2019s ability to quickly and efficiently transition to electric vehicles. And the Trump administration ignored an earlier court order to lift a broad freeze on federal funds, afederal judge ruled this week.Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s NEVI freeze has sown confusion across the country, with EV stakeholders and state governments scrambling to figure out what the funding pause will mean and how to respond.Beyond Alabama, interviews across the country found officials in deep red Wyoming contemplating a possible return of funds, while those in progressive states like Illinois and Maryland remain firmly committed to the EV buildout, with or without federal funding. In purple North Carolina, officials are in limbo, having already spent some NEVI funds, but not sure how to proceed with the next round of projects.AlabamaIn Alabama, officials had already announced plans to fund more than a dozen chargers at sites across the state along interstates and major highways, including installing two dual-port chargers at eight Love\u2019s Travel Stops and another at Priester\u2019s Pecans off I-65 in Fort Deposit.At the time, state officials, including Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, praised the funding.\u201cHaving strategic electric vehicle charging stations across Alabama not only benefits EV drivers, but it also benefits those companies that produce electric vehicles, including many of them right here in Alabama, resulting in more high-paying jobs for Alabamians,\u201d Ivey said when the funding allocation was announced in July 2024. \u201cThis latest round of projects will provide added assurance that Alabamians and travelers to our state who choose electric vehicles can travel those highways and know a charging station is within a reliable distance on their routes.\u201dIn total, Alabama was set to receive $79 million in funding through the program, including $2.4 million to expand training programs for the installation, testing, operation, and maintenance of EVs and EV chargers at Bevill State Community College in the central part of the state. The college did not respond to a request for comment on whether the money had been disbursed to the institution before the announced pause.Credit:Paul Horn/Inside Climate NewsIn an email exchange this week, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs confirmed what the agency had posted to its website in the wake of Trump\u2019s inauguration\u2014that the state would pause NEVI projects and await further guidance from the Trump administration.Even with a pause, however, stakeholders in Alabama and across the country have expressed a commitment to continuing the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.For its part, Love\u2019s Travel Stops, a 42-state chain that had been set to receive more than $5.8 million in funding for EV chargers in Alabama alone, said it will continue to roll out electric chargers at locations nationwide.\u201cLove\u2019s remains committed to meeting customers\u2019 needs regardless of fuel type and believes a robust electric vehicle charging network is a part of that,\u201d Kim Okafor, general manager of zero emissions for Love's, said in an emailed statement. \u201cLove\u2019s will continue to monitor related executive orders and subsequent changes in law to determine the next steps. This includes the Alabama Department of Transportation\u2019s Electric Vehicle charging plan timelines.\u201dThe state of Alabama, meanwhile, has its own EV charger program apart from NEVI that has already funded millions of dollars worth of charging infrastructure.In January, even after its announced pause of NEVI implementation, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs announced the awarding of six grants totaling $2.26 million from state funds for the construction of EV chargers in Huntsville, Hoover, Tuscaloosa, and Mobile.\u201cThe installation of electric vehicle charging stations at places like hotels are investments that can attract customers and add to local economies,\u201d ADECA Director Kenneth Boswell said at the time.North CarolinaIn North Carolina, the full buildout of the state\u2019s electric charging network under NEVI is in limbo just four months after the NC Department of Transportation announced the initial recipients of the funds.NC DOT spokesman Jamie Kritzer said that based on the federal government\u2019s directive, the agency is continuing with awarded projects but \u201cpausing\u201d the next round of requests for proposals, as well as future phases of the buildout.If that pause were to become permanent, the state would be forced to abandon $103 million in federal infrastructure money that would have paid for an additional 41 stations to be built as part of Phase 1.Last September the state announced it hadawarded nearly $6 millionto six companies to build nine public charging stations. Locations include shopping centers, travel plazas, and restaurants, most of them in economically disadvantaged communities.NEVI requires EV charging stations in the first phase to be installed every 50 miles along the federallyapproved alternative fuel corridors, and that they be within one mile of those routes. The state has also prioritized Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) stations, which can charge a vehicle to 80 percent in 20 to 30 minutes.The NEVI program is structured to reimburse private companies for up to 80 percent of the cost to construct and operate electric vehicle charging stations for five years, after which the charging stations will continue to operate without government support, according to the state DOT.The state estimated it would have taken two to three years to finish Phase 1.Under Phase 2, the state would award federal funds to build community-level electric vehicle charging stations, farther from the major highways, including in disadvantaged communities.That is particularly important in North Carolina, which has thesecond-largest rural populationin the US in terms of percentage. A third of the state\u2019s residents live in rural areas, which are underserved by electric vehicle charging stations.There are already more than 1,700 public electric charging stations and 4,850 ports in North Carolina, according to theUS Department of Energy\u2019s Alternative Fuels Data Center. But they aren\u2019t evenly dispersed throughout the state. Alleghany and Ashe counties, in the western mountains, have just one charging station each.Credit:Paul Horn/Insider Climate NewsVickie Atkinson, who lives in the country between Chapel Hill and Pittsboro in central North Carolina, drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Escape, which is powered by an electric engine or gas, unlike full electric models, which have no gas option. Plug-in hybrids typically have fully electric ranges of 35 to 40 miles.\u201cI try to drive on battery whenever possible,\u201d Atkinson said. But she\u2019s frustrated that she can\u2019t drive from her home to downtown Siler City and back\u2014a 60-mile round trip\u2014without resorting to the gas engine. There are two chargers on the outskirts along US 64\u2014only one of them is a fast charger\u2014but none downtown.\u201cI really hope the chargers are installed,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cI fear they won\u2019t and I find that very frustrating.\u201dFormer Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, advocated for wider adoption of electric vehicles and infrastructure. In a 2018 executive order, Cooper established a benchmark of 80,000 registered zero-emission vehicles in the state by 2025.North Carolina met that goal. State DOT registration data shows there were 81,658 electric vehicles and 24,457 plug-in hybrids as of September, the latest figures available.Cooper issued a subsequent executive order in 2022 that set a more aggressive goal: 1.2 million registered electric vehicles by 2030. At the current pace of electric vehicle adoption, it\u2019s unlikely the state will achieve that benchmark.The electric vehicle industry is an economic driver in North Carolina. Toyota just opened a $13.9 billion battery plant in the small town of Liberty and says it will create about 5,100 new jobs. The company is scheduled to begin shipping batteries in April.Natron Energy is building a plant in Edgecombe County, east of Raleigh, to manufacture sodium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Experts say they are cheaper and environmentally superior to lithium-ion batteries and less likely to catch fire,although they store less energy.The global companyKempoweropened its first North American factory in Durham, where it builds charging infrastructure. Jed Routh, its vice president of markets and products for North America, said that while \u201cthe rapidly shifting market is difficult to forecast and interest in electric vehicles may slow at times over the next four years, we don\u2019t expect it to go away. We believe that the industry will remain strong and Kempower remains committed to define, produce, and improve EV charging infrastructure throughout North America.\u201dNorth Carolina does have a separate funding source for electric charging stations that is protected from the Trump administration\u2019s program cuts and cancellations. The state received $92 million from Volkswagen, part of the EPA\u2019s multi-billion-dollar national settlement in 2016 with the car company, which had installed software in some of its diesel cars to cheat on emissions tests.The Department of Environmental Quality used the settlement money to pay for 994 EV charging ports at 318 sites in North Carolina. The agency expects to add more charging stations with $1.8 million in unspent settlement funds.Electrify America was created by the Volkswagen Group of America to implement a $2 billion portion of the settlement. It required the car company to invest in electric charging infrastructure and in the promotion of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Electrify America operates 20 charging NEVI-compliant, high-speed stations in North Carolina, using the settlement money. However, the funding pause could affect the company because it works with potential site developers and small businesses to comply with the NEVI requirements.The company is still reviewing the details in the federal memo, company spokeswoman Tara Geiger said.\u201cElectrify America continues to engage with stakeholders to understand developments impacting the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program,\u201d Geiger wrote in an email. \u201cWe remain committed to growing our coast-to-coast Hyper-Fast network to support transportation electrification.\u201dWyomingIn Wyoming, Doug McGee, a state Department of Transportation spokesperson, said the agency is taking a wait and see approach to NEVI moving forward, and is not ruling out a return of funding. About half a dozen people at the department handle NEVI along with other daily responsibilities, McGee said, and it will be easy for them to put NEVI on hold while they await further instruction.The department was in the process of soliciting proposals for EV charging stations and has not yet spent any money under NEVI. \u201cThere was very little to pause,\u201d McGee said.Across 6,800 miles of highway in Wyoming, there are 110 public EV charging stations, making the state\u2019s EV infrastructure the third-smallest in the country, ahead of charging networks in only North Dakota and Alaska.IllinoisMore progressive states, including Illinois, have explicitly said they will redouble their efforts to support the expansion of EV charging infrastructure in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s NEVI pause.The state of Illinois has said it remains committed to the goal of helping consumers and the public sector transition to EVs in 2025 through state funding sources, even if some NEVI projects are halted.Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd), the largest electric utility in Illinois and the primary electric provider in Chicago, alsoannounced a $100 million rebate programon Feb. 6 at the Chicago Auto Show, funds that are currently available to boost EV adoption throughout the state.The funds are for residential EV charger and installation costs, all-electric fleet vehicles, and charging infrastructure in both the public and private sectors.According to Cristina Botero, senior manager for beneficial electrification at ComEd, the rebate is part of a total investment of $231 million from ComEd as part of its Beneficial Electrification plan programs to promote electrification and EV adoption.While the $231 million won\u2019t be impacted by the Trump administration\u2019s order, other EV projects funded by NEVI are halted. In 2022, for example, $148 million from NEVI was set to be disbursed in Illinois over the course of five years, focusing on Direct Current Fast Charging to fulfill the requirement to build charging stations every 50 miles,according to the Illinois Department of Transportation.\u201cWe are still in the process of reviewing the impacts of last week\u2019s order and evaluating next steps going forward,\u201d said Maria Castaneda, spokesperson at IDOT, in an emailed statement.The NEVI funds were also set to help achieve Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s goal to have 1 million EVs on Illinois roads by 2030. Officials estimated that at least 10,000 EV charging stations are needed in order to achieve this 2030 goal. Last fall, there were 1,200 charging stations open to the public.In January,Illinois was awardedfederal funds totaling $114 million from the US Department of Transportation to build 14 truck charging hubs, adding to the statewide charging infrastructure.According to Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs for the Respiratory Health Association, most of that funding is either frozen or at risk.However, programs like the recent ComEd rebate will not be impacted. \u201cThis is at the state level and not dictated by federal policy,\u201d Botero said.MarylandIn Maryland, state officials are trying to assess the fallout and find alternative ways to keep EV infrastructure efforts alive. The outcome hinges on new federal guidance and potential legal battles over the suspension.Maryland is allocated $63 million over five years under NEVI. The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) launched the first $12.1 million round last summer to build 126 fast-charging ports at 22 sites across many of the state\u2019s counties. At least some are expected to be operational by late 2025.In December, MDOT issued a new call for proposals for building up to 29 additional highway charging stations, expecting stable federal support. At the time, senior MDOT officialstoldInside Climate News they were confident in the program\u2019s security since it was authorized under law.But Trump\u2019s funding pause has upended those plans.\u201cThe Maryland Department of Transportation is moving forward with its obligated NEVI funding and is awaiting new guidance from the U.S. Department of Transportation to advance future funding rounds,\u201d said Carter Elliott, a spokesperson for Gov. Wes Moore, in an emailed statement.The Moore administration reaffirmed its commitment to EV expansion, calling charging essential to reducing consumer costs and cutting climate pollution. \u201cGov. Moore is committed to making the state more competitive by pressing forward with the administration\u2019s strategy to deliver charging infrastructure for clean cars to drivers across the state,\u201d the statement added.In written comments, an MDOT spokesperson said the agency is determining its options for future funding needs and solicitations.Katherine Garc\u00eda, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Clean Transportation for All program, said that freezing the EV charging funds was an unsound and illegal move by the Trump administration. \u201cThis is an attack on bipartisan funding that Congress approved years ago and is driving investment and innovation in every state,\u201d she said.She said that the NEVI program is helping the US build out the infrastructure needed to support the transition to vehicles that don\u2019t pollute the air.The Sierra Club\u2019s Josh Stebbins lamented the slow pace of the EV charger buildout across the state. \u201cWe are not sure when Maryland's NEVI chargers will be operational,\u201d he said. \u201cStates must move faster and accelerate the installation of NEVI stations. It has been frustratingly slow, and the public needs to see a return on its investment.\u201dMaryland EV ambitions are high stakes. Transportation remains the state\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and public officials and advocates see EV adoption as critical to meet its net-zero carbon goal by 2045. NEVI is also a key plank of the state\u2019s broader Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Planning initiative, designed to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.What happens nextAs litigation is brought over the Trump administration\u2019s pause on NEVI funds, experts like Turnbull of the Alliance for Transportation Electrification believe the United States remains, despite this bump, on the road toward electrification.\u201cWe are not shifting into reverse,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe EV market will continue to grow across all market segments driven by market innovation and consumer demand, both within the United States and globally. By pretending the EV transition doesn\u2019t exist, this administration risks the US\u2019s global competitiveness, national security, and economic growth.\u201dLee Hedgepeth, Aman Azhar, Jake Bolster, Lisa Sorg, Sarah Mattalian, Inside Climate NewsLee Hedgepeth, Aman Azhar, Jake Bolster, Lisa Sorg, Sarah Mattalian, Inside Climate News300 Comments", "date": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 12:07:10 +0000", "source": "Ars Technica Security", "viewed": false, "highlights": [], "category": "cybersecurity"}, "39": {"id": 1, "title": "How Diablo hackers uncovered a speedrun scandal", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/", "summary": "Investigators decompiled the game to search through 2.2 billion random dungeon seeds.", "content": "Text\n        settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navFor years, Maciej \"Groobo\" Maselewski\u00a0stood as the undisputed champion ofDiablospeedrunning. His3-minute, 12-second Sorcerer runlooked all but unbeatable thanks to a combination of powerful (and allowable) glitch exploits along with what seemed like some unbelievable luck in the game's randomly generated dungeon.But when a team of other speedrunners started trying and failing to replicate that luck using outside software and analysis tools, the story behind Groobo's run began to fall apart. As the inconsistencies in the runstarted to mount, that team would conduct an automated search through billions of legitimateDiablodungeons to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Groobo's game couldn't have taken place in any of them.\"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper,\" team member Staphen told Ars Technica of their investigation. \"Betrayal might be another way to describe it,\" team member AJenbo added. \"To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement.\"If we have unearned luckIf you have any familiarity withDiabloor speedrunning,watching Groobo's runfeels like watching someone win the lottery. First, there's the dungeon itself, which features a sequence of stairways that appear just steps from each other, forming a quick and enemy-free path down to the dungeon's deeper levels. Then there's Groobo's lucky find ofNaj's Puzzleron level 9, a unique item that enables the teleporting necessary for many of the run's late-game maneuvers.Groobo's 3:12Diablospeedrun, as submitted to Speed Demos Archive in 2009\"It seemed very unusual that we would have so many levels with the upstairs and the downstairs right next to each other,\" Allan \"DwangoAC\" Cecil told Ars Technica. \"We wanted to find some way of replicating this.\"When Cecil and a team of tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) authors started that search process in earnest last February, they said they used Groobo's run as a baseline to try to improve from. While Groobo ostensibly had to rely on his own human luck in prepping his run, the TAS runners could use techniques and tools from outside the game to replicate Groobo's run (or something very similar) every time.To find an RNG seed that could do just that, the TAS teamcreated a custom-built map generation toolby reverse-engineering a disassembledDiabloexecutable. That tool can take any of the game's billions of possible random seeds and quickly determine the map layout, item distribution, and quest placement available in the generated save file. A scanner built on top of that tool can then quickly look through those generated dungeons for ones that might be optimal for speedrunning.\"We were working on finding the best seed for our TAS, and we were trying to identify the seed from Groobo's run, both to validate that our scanner works and to potentially straight-up use it for the run,\" Stephan said of the effort. \"We naturally had a lot of trouble finding [that seed] because it doesn't exist.\"A thorough searchIn their effort to find Groobo's storied run (or at least one that resembled it), the TAS team conducted a distributed search across the game's roughly 2.2 billion validRNG seeds. Each of these seeds represents a different specific second on the system clock when aDiablosave file is created, ranging from between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2038 (the only valid dates accepted by the game).After comparing each of those billions of those RNG dungeons to a re-creation of the dungeon seen in Groobo's run, the team couldn't find a single example containing the crucial level 9 Naj's Puzzler drop. After that, the team started searching through \"impossible\" seeds, which could only be created byusing save modification toolsto force a creation date after the year 2038.The team eventually found dungeons matching Naj's Puzzler drop in Groobo's video, using seeds associated with the years 2056 and 2074.After an exhaustive search, the TAS team couldn't find a dungeon with Naj's Puzzler dropped in the place Groobo's run said it should be.Credit:Analysis of Groobo's Diablo WR SpeedrunAfter an exhaustive search, the TAS team couldn't find a dungeon with Naj's Puzzler dropped in the place Groobo's run said it should be.Credit:Analysis of Groobo's Diablo WR SpeedrunThe early presumption that Groobo's run was legitimate ended up costing the team weeks of work. \"It was baffling when we couldn't find [the early Naj's Puzzler] in any of the searches we did,\" Cecil said. \"We were always worried that the scanner might have bugs in it,\" Staphen added.The TAS team's thorough search also showed troubling inconsistencies in the other dungeon levels shown in Groobo's run. \"Normally you would only need to identify a single level to replicate a run since all the other levels are generated from the same seed,\" AJenbo told Ars. But the levels seen in Groobo's run came from multiple different seeds, which would require splicing footage from multiple different playthrough of different dungeons. That's a big no-no even ina so-called \"segmented\" run, which is still supposed to contain segments from a single unmodified save file.\"At that point we also wanted to figure out how manipulated the run was,\" AJenbo said. \"Was it a legit run except for [dungeon level] 9? Was it three good runs combined? In the end we only found two levels that had come from the same run so at least 13 (probably 15) runs were spliced into one video, which is a lot for a game with just 16 levels.\"The evidence piles upAfter Groobo's dungeon generation problems came to light, other inconsistencies in his run started to become apparent. Some of these are relatively easy to spot with the naked eye once you know what you're looking for.For instance, the \"1996\u20132001\" copyright date seen on the title screen in Groobo's video is inconsistent with the v1.00 shown on the initial menu screen, suggesting Groobo's run was spliced together from runs on multiple different versions of the game. Items acquired early in the run also disappear from the inventory later on with no apparent explanation.This copyright date doesn't line up with the \"V1.00\" seen later on the menu screen in Groobo's run.Credit:Analysis of Groobo's Diablo WR SpeedrunThis copyright date doesn't line up with the \"V1.00\" seen later on the menu screen in Groobo's run.Credit:Analysis of Groobo's Diablo WR SpeedrunEven months after the investigation first started, new inconsistencies are still coming to light. Groobo's final fight against Diablo, for instance, required just 19 fireballs to take him out. While that's technically possible with perfect luck for the level 12 Sorcerer seen in the footage, the TAS team found that the specific damage dealt and boss behavior only matched when they attempted the same attacks using a level 26 Sorcerer.After the TAS team compiled their many findingsinto a lengthy document, Groobo defended his submission in a discussion with Cecil (screenshots of which were viewed by Ars Technica). \"My run is a segmented/spliced run,\" Groobo said. \"It always has been and it was never passed off as anything else, nor was it part of any competition or leaderboards. The Speed Demos Archive [SDA] page states that outright.\" Indeed,an archived version of Groobo's record-setting Speed Demos Archive submissiondoes say directly that it's made up of \"27 segments appended to one file.\"But simply splitting a run into segments doesn't explain away all of the problems the TAS team found. Getting Naj's Puzzler on dungeon level 9, for instance, still requires outside modification of a save file, which is specifically prohibited bylongstanding Speed Demos Archive rulesthat \"manually editing/adding/removing game files is generally not allowed.\" Groobo's apparent splicing of multiple game versions and differently seeded save files also seems to go against SDA rules, which say that \"there obviously needs to be continuity between segments in terms of inventory, experience points or whatever is applicable for the individual game.\"After being presented with the TAS team's evidence, SDAwrotethat \"it has been determined that Groobo's run very likely does not stem from only legitimate techniques, and as such, has itself been banished barring new developments.\" But Groobo's record isstill listed as the \"Fastest completion of an RPG videogame\"by Guinness World Records, which has not offered a substantive response to the team's findings (Guinness has not responded to a request for comment from Ars Technica).A recentDiablospeedrun on a confirmed legitimate dungeon seed.This might seem like a pretty petty issue to spend weeks of time and attention debunking. But at a recent presentation attended by Ars, Cecil said he was motivated to pursue it because \"it did harm. Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category [ofDiablo]. No one tried, no one could.\"Because of Groobo's previously unknown modifications to make an impossible-to-beat run, \"this big running community just stopped trying to run this game in that category,\" Cecil said. \"For more than a decade, this had a chilling impact on that community.\" With Groobo's run out of the way, though, new runners aresetting new records on confirmed legitimate RNG seeds, andwith the aid of TAS tools.In the end, Cecil said he hopes the evidence regarding Groobo's run will make people look more carefully at other record submissions. \"Groobo had created a number of well-respected ... speedruns,\" he said. \"[People thought] there wasn't any good reason to doubt him. In other words, there was bias in familiarity. This was a familiar character. Why would they cheat?\"Kyle OrlandSenior Gaming EditorKyle OrlandSenior Gaming EditorKyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica since 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind video games.
